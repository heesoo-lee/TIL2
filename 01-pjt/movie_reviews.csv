1087192,6852fe22c2a2330a025d8605,CinemaSerf,"Whatever happened to Brenton Thwaites? For some reason that crossed my mind as this thoroughly entertaining fantasy adventure gets off to a rollicking start and keeps going. Now if you are the “Hagar”-esque Viking chief (Gerard Butler) expecting your son to take over as fearless dragon-chaser after you, why would you call him “Hiccup”? Might as well call him “Buttercup”? Anyway, that hapless lad (Mason Thames) maybe isn’t the most adept on the muscle front but cerebrally he has something of the Leonardo Da Vinci to him as he determines to set about devising a weapon that will tackle the most formidable of their foes - the “Night Fury”. Well, would you believe it - his contraption actually works, but instead of slaying the thing this young man decides that the decades of combat between the species has accomplished nothing, so he decides a bit of co-operation might be in order instead. Of course, he has to be fairly clandestine about this as his dad will go ape if he finds out and fellow, and competitive, student “Astrid” (Nico Parker) - on whom he has a terrible crush - might decide to take her axe to both him and his new friend. There are a few slight modifications from the animation (2010) but otherwise it largely sticks to the story with a lovely hammy effort from Butler, an enjoyably mischievous one from his multi-appendage sidekick “Gobber” (Nick Frost) and two solid performances from the leads. It’s Thames who really steals the show amongst the humans, with a cheeky and personable effort which must have been quite a task as he spent much of the filming dangling in front of a green screen. As to the visuals, they are great. A combination of dragons galore, huge scale pyrotechnics and loads of imagination immerses you into a story of family and friendship without even the vaguest hint of the moralising that often peppers this genre. They say that, aerodynamically, a bee ought never to be able to fly: well I think that could be said of almost all of the critters here as they dart about menacingly and colourfully for a couple of hours of what is really good fun. It’s well worth a cinema outing as the whole thing looks and sounds great on a big screen and dare I say it, I might quite like a sequel if they can keep the standard of storytelling up to that of the imagery.",7.0

Maybe I’m thinking of another robotic and plastic manifestation of womanhood? Anyway, this sees “Gemma” (Allison Williams) and her pals caught up with investment problems whilst Uncle Sam’s latest AI specimen “Amelia” (Ivanna Sakhno) goes off the rails. Pretty swiftly, thanks to the intervention of the newly mobile tech gazillionaire “Alt” (Jermaine Clement), she finds herself working on something she’d vowed never to touch again, else niece “Cady” (Violet McGraw) is gonna be toast. Luckily, she can count on the help of the benevolent “Christian” (Aristotle Athari) and a supply of kit that could build a space shuttle from scratch. Of course we, watching, all know this is bound to be but a cunning ploy by the demonic robot to reincarnate and cause havoc, and so down the predictably latex brick road we go. Now it’s not actually that much worse than the first film. There are some pithy lines contained amidst the endless dialogue and there are even a few laughs to be had as the acrobatics see furniture trashed and limbs torn asunder with the reliability of a “John Wick” film. The acting is all pretty feeble but I did quite enjoy the messy savagery of the denouement even if it is very nearly smothered in a syrupy gloop of disappointing sentiment and by the time it was all over, I was surprised that I didn’t hate it.

 ""Lilo & Stitch is one of Disney's most adorable, emotionally sincere live-action remakes to date.
 
 With charming performances - protect Maia Kealoha at all costs - an incredibly cute Stitch, and a heart as big as the world, Dean Fleischer Camp proves that there's room for new versions when they're made with soul and purpose.
 
 The human-alien relationship remains the driving force of a simple yet deeply moving story that reminds us of the true meaning of ""ohana"". It's not perfect, but like its protagonists, it's perfectly imperfect. And that's enough.""

552524,68385a4b4b131e3159eb4540,CinemaSerf,"Hmmm! I wasn’t sure if I was watching a sentimental edition of “Hawaii Five-O” here or a collection of outtakes from a “Sonic” movie as this rather disappointingly trundles along for the guts of two hours. It’s starts off quite promisingly as we see the “Grand Councilwoman” sentence the latest creation of madcap scientist “Jumba” to exile under the supervision of himself and Earth expert “Pleakley”. It turns out that the eponymous blue critter is actually quite a malevolent beastie adept at causing no end of mischief, and with the authorities now on his tail, he concludes that the safest thing to do is to hide in plain sight and get him self adopted by the none-too-bright “Lilo” (Maia Kealoha) who actually thinks he’s a dog! What is even dafter is that her elder sister “Nani” (Sydney Agudong) also reckons there is nothing so abnormal about a lively blue pet that can enunciate - though that’s perhaps because she is dazzled by the affections of the beefcake poster boy next door “David” (the hilariously wooden Kaipo Dudoit). Anyway, that’s the scene set as the predicable character arcs take us on a journey from bereavement and rebelliousness to the certainty of it’s long-in-coming denouement. It has it’s Laurel and Hardy moments, and at times there is some very light comedy - usually from Billy Magnussen, but I’m afraid that the story hasn’t the courage of it’s initially mischievous convictions and I rather lost interest as a sea of sentiment washed over me. Maybe it needs a “Brightburn” style director’s cut to spice it up a bit, but as it is it is an ok watch for the kids but not much more.",6.0
552524,683c6f832f2257d8f4537fb9,Chris Sawin,"While watching Disney’s new live-action version of Lilo & Stitch, the film felt fairly accurate to the original 2002 animated film for the first half of the film while the second half seemed insanely different in comparison. However, upon revisiting the original film, the live-action version features many unwanted modifications.
 
 Pleakley and Jumba are butchered in the new film. Now played by Billy Magnussen and Zach Galifianakis respectively both spend the majority of the film as humans (they use alien technology to mimic humans early in the film). This was likely done as a cost-cutting measure, especially after the opening of the film is all CGI, but it’s awkward. Lilo & Stitch was originally meant as a Disney+ exclusive and has the lowest budget ($100 million) of any Disney live-action remake since Cruella.
 
 Magnussen at least has the same personality and a similar voice to Kevin McDonald’s in the original film. The new film turns Jumba into the main villain and strips the character of his Russian accent. In the original film, Jumba is hunting Stitch up until the point where Stitch simply asks Jumba to help him which he abides by.
 
 As humans, both Magnussen and Galifianakis seem to be wearing false teeth or something as they both have overbites that completely alter their speech. It gives the characters this uncanny valley appearance that is way more unsettling than it should be.
 
 Cobra Bubbles is no longer a former CIA agent turned CPS social worker. He’s now just a CIA agent with no personality whatsoever. Courtney B. Vance portrays Bubbles in the film and while his acting skills are fine his frame isn’t big enough. Oddly, Disney is currently hiring actors who never saw the original film for their remakes though. Galifianakis didn’t even know who Jumba was while Courtney B. Vance didn’t watch the film because Stitch scared his kids. It’s no wonder their performances aren’t satisfying.
 
 The new film splits the Bubbles character into two characters. Bubbles is a straightforward CIA agent while Tia Carrere (the original voice of Nani) portrays the CPS social worker and is essentially all of the softer and kinder aspects that made Bubbles interesting. She manifests what made Bubbles interesting, but is otherwise a bit flat while trying to be a worthwhile character on her own.
 
 Lilo and Nani now have neighbors who are also part of their Ohana. The film strips David of whatever charm he may have had in the animated film. Kaipo Dudoi portrays him as a bumbling idiot who can’t talk or put a sentence together to save his life. His grandma Tutu (Amy Hill) is almost never in the film without riding her 4-wheeler. She takes Lilo to the pound to pick up Stitch behind Nani’s back whereas it was Nani’s idea in the animated film.
 
 Some big alterations come in the form of both Lilo and Stitch. Lilo lashed out in the animated film but had a vivid imagination. In the new film, Maia Kealoha has the right voice and mannerisms, but the way she is written injects all of the obnoxious behavior of her character and none of what makes her interesting.
 
 In the 2002 film, Stitch doesn’t say more than three or four words at a time until the ending where he asks to say goodbye and talks about his little and broken family still being good. Most of his dialogue is his alien language and various catchphrases. He begins talking in full sentences halfway into the live-action film. There are also no cute and fluffy jokes, which is a crime in itself.
 
 The new film erases Stitch’s infatuation with The Ugly Duckling, which feels like a huge story shift. Stitch learns what family is and learns that he doesn’t have parents because he was made in a lab and not born naturally. He relates to The Ugly Duckling because he wants to be a part of a family. A family he never had can’t come pick him up or make him feel better, so he finds his own.
 
 There’s also this new concept of Stitch getting heavier the longer he’s in the water. This new story element will obviously factor into how things unfold later in the film, but Stitch didn’t like water originally and couldn’t swim. For possessing “enhanced intellect,” deciding to go into the water when you can’t swim and because you’ll likely never reach the surface again if you fall in seems dumb.
 
 The other differences are mostly little ones that are still bothersome. There’s less of an emphasis on Elvis and his music, Stitch loses his red alien clothes after he’s run over in the animated film whereas he just kind of lands naked in the live-action one, he adores cake in the live-action film whereas he takes one bite and then spits it back up whole in the animated, there’s no coin-operated spaceship sequence or Stitch getting into the laundry and wearing a bra on his head and a towel like a cape to look like a superhero, and he hijacks a Power Wheels in the new film instead of a Big Wheel.
 
 The film looks fairly good, as all of the animated characters transitioned to live-action rather seamlessly. All of the Stitch sequences are great. Stitch's interactions with Lilo are still fun. The sequences with Jumba’s portal gun are some of the best in the live-action film. As a huge fan of the original film, this remake suffers from feeling unnecessary, especially since Stitch is still one of the most popular Disney characters.
 
 Lilo & Stitch is a watchable live-action Disney remake with some entertaining moments, but its knack for revising half of what made the animated version memorable and molding it into something more mediocre is baffling.",6.0

 The writing felt a bit all over the place but most of the jokes were on point, the action was very enjoyable, and I think giving Superman a more classic comic feel and less of the apocalyptic Snyder vibe was a good change.
 
 Everyone here does a great job with the acting. Lois and Jimmy are, in my opinion, the standouts. Nicholas Hoult wasn't a great choice for Luthor, with his more manic energy. Personally, I enjoyed Hackman or Cryer's cold, cunning version more. 
 
 And, y'all, Krypto is in it. Finally we got a dog!
 
 TLDR: It's good but not great. With that said, I still think you'll have a great time watching it. Also, DEFINITELY SEE IT IN 3D.
 
 
 
 ***SPOILERS BELOW***
 
 I have two complaints. 
 
 They give us two of Superman's coolest villains: Lex Luthor and Bizarro, but lame versions of both. I was expecting something on par with Iron Man vs Ironmonger circa 2008, but Lex never dons his suit. I was pretty sure the masked villain was Bizarro, and later he's revealed to be, but it would have been so much better if the authentic version had been written in.",7.0

 ""Superman isn't perfect. It struggles with pacing, has too many characters, and offers some clunky narrative solutions. But as the official cinematic introduction to the new DCU, it succeeds where it matters most: establishing the central pillars of the saga, giving us a worthy protagonist, and showcasing a filmmaker with a clear vision.
 
 David Corenswet is the Superman this generation needs: a symbol of kindness, hope, and - above all - conviction-led action. Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult round out a high-quality central trio, and even with its flaws, it's hard not to leave the theater satisfied.
 
 James Gunn delivers a clear statement of intent: DC's future is in good hands. Bring on the rest of Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. If this is the path forward, maybe - finally - DC can fly as high as its greatest hero.""

1061474,68730dad8a675c21b270517e,Brent Marchant,"Considerable chatter has been devoted in recent years to the question of whether the movie industry is producing too many superhero/action-adventure films. Much of that talk has specifically focused on whether certain franchises/mythologies have been overdone. That’s particularly true where the “Superman” mythos is concerned, a body of work that has assumed multiple forms on TV and the big screen since the 1970s. And, after viewing this latest iteration involving this storied and much beloved character, I can’t help but concur with the opinion that the man from the planet Krypton needs to be given a serious rest for a while. In my opinion, what has been called the biggest disappointment of this summer’s blockbuster season is an assessment that’s, unfortunately, right on target. In short, writer-director James Gunn’s latest is a hot mess that strains viewer interest not long into its overlong 2:09:00 runtime (a duration that honestly feels even longer than the official tally) and never manages to get it back. The biggest problem here rests with an overstuffed narrative that at times becomes challenging to follow, thanks to a screenplay that’s loaded with incongruities, rampant assumptions and a noticeable lack of back story; film editing tediously in need of much-needed snipping; overreliance on comic relief that grows progressively tiresome (especially with Superman’s annoyingly overzealous canine pal, Krypto); and an overall production whose vision is both tedious and not particularly original (especially in the rather ho-hum action sequences that we’ve seen so many, many times before in better films, most notably those from the Marvel Universe). In addition, the picture’s attempts at updating the nature of the Superman mythology for the present day are uneven at best, including some elements that are sufficiently contemporary with others that are woefully anachronistic (e.g., why are elements involving The Daily Planet newspaper portrayed in much the same way as they were in the past, given that today’s journalism business is a very different animal from what it was years ago?). To its credit, the film’s attempts at evolving the protagonist’s character into a paragon of “wokeness” (a source of much criticism in some circles) provides an intriguing spin on the nature of the Man of Steel – one very much in line with Superman’s traditional embodiment as a champion of “truth, justice and the American way” – even if it is somewhat excessive on occasion. That’s especially true where matters involving “aliens” (like Kal El himself) are symbolically demonized as threats to society, a less-than-subtle allusion to how many perceive today’s immigrants. However, the attempt at making the film’s hero more socially relevant is at times undermined by inconsistent character development, a problem that plagues many of this release’s other players, too. And that’s unfortunate in light of the performances on display, including a capable Christopher Reeve-esque portrayal by the film’s lead (David Corenswet), as well as fine supporting characterizations of mythology staples Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult). In essence, though, “Superman” regrettably feels like an offering created by committee, a production that desperately should have gone through several more rounds of revisions before being committed to a final print. What’s more, if this picture was meant to lead off a new franchise involving this character, it comes up short all around, a prospect that doesn’t bode particularly well for the artistic future of this series. Superman deserves better than this, but that’s noticeably lacking in this release, one that, over time, is likely to become forgettable, particularly when measured against its superior predecessors, films that commendably and authentically depict its protagonist as a genuinely super-man.",4.0
1061474,68765b744d8f3d9b79a7b114,CrazyJekyll,"First of all i would like to say that this isnt a bad movie by any means. In fact there's actually a lot to enjoy here and is easily the BEST live-action Superman movie since the Christopher Reeve era.
 
 Corenswet as Superman/Clark is fucking amazing and the characterization of Supes would've been perfect if it weren't for that one plot twist (more on that later). I also like that thay made a point but its more on his ACTIONS that define who you are. Hoult is also spectacular, you can just feel his hate and anger and those nasty little evil smirks everytime he wins against our boy in blue. Rachel Brosnahan is also fucking perfect as Lois Lane and her interactions with not only Clark but also the Justice Gang is pure comic Lois. And to top it all of, the action, score, and visual imagery are all very much comic book-esque and just straight up fucking beautiful to see. (Mr Terrific and Metamorpho are both so good and entertaining).
 
 BUT there is one big twist here that 90% of the general audience won't care about, but as a comic fan the twist just brings this movie down from like a 8-9/10 to a 6-7/10. That twist is just that BAD atleast for someone like me who is a big big Superman comic fan.
 
 SPOILERS FROM NOW ON:
 
 Now for the big plot twist. Making the House of El (Jor El and Lara) evil and Superman believing himself to be more human than alien was a really really bad choice. As i mentioned before, i know that the whole point is that Kal or Superman or Clark is more defined by his ACTIONS rather than his heritage. But to make them completely evil and have clark reject his heritage at the end (completely replacing his krypton parents with footage from his earth parents) just really sucks.
 
 FIRST OF ALL the decision to make them evil just ruins the immigrant allegory. If you've read the comics you would know that Clark is a deeply lonely guy. Having to grow up knowing you're an alien, is different from everyone else and would constantly need to hide his powers and true self. He is afraid of being REJECTED and is the reason why he constantly yearns for his home planet krypton, a place where he could actually feel like himself and not some outsider. So to make his whole origin planet evil?? is not really helping the immigrant allegory. Like imagine if your an immigrant to the USA and suddenly in the news everyone says that your home country and everyone from there is fucking evil. STRAIGHT UP XENOPHOBIA. And to say that Clark wouldn't care about his parents and origin planet because he didnt know them is stupid. I think that Learning your father was a man who tried but failed to save a world that wouldn't listen to him would definitely have an impact on a guy who's trying to save the world everyday.
 
 A comic issue that showcased his loneliness and fear of rejection from humans is ACTION COMICS #794 where we see Clark in his adolescence watching a film with his friends, wherein the aliens are the villains and everyone around him js cheering for the aliens to go back to their planets. Imagine the pain and loneliness you would feel knowing that everyone around you even your friends just want you to go the fuck away.
 
 Also this is exactly why his origin needs to be truly adapted because thats where his character, morality, and such really shine. It's not only where his identity crisis and loneliness are explicitly explored but also where we see that it is not only his actions that define him but also the synthesis of all his experiences juggling his alien and human side. It also adds layers to his eventual rivalry with Lex, and shows his relationship with other super powered beings like the Legion.
 
 In relation to that, this is also why SUPERBOY is important to be shown/adapated because its with his heroics as a teen that led to him meeting other heroes mainly the Legion of Superheroes. His adventures with the Legion is where he truly finds who he is, because like him they're also teens going through the same problems. With the legion he finally got a community where he doesn't have to hide anything, can share his problems that no other human can get and most importantly feel less LONELY and feel VALIDATED knowing that a future where superpowered beings are accepted actually exist.
 
 (Also quick side note, this is also why him dating and losing his virginity to mermaid Lori Lemaris is so important to me. Sex and Intimacy is often done with someone you can be vulnerable with, and a mermaid or another kryptonian Lyra Lerrol be his first time is just so fitting. ADAPT SUPERBOY AND LORI PLEASE)
 
 Him yearning for his kryptonian heritage also doesnt make him less human. Because why else would he still choose and create his secret identity/persona Clark Kent if he wants to reject it. Clark is his own guilty little pleasure of living as a human because even if he is an alien it shows that he still enjoys earth and cherishes humanity and its culture. He is supposed to be the BEST of both worlds and having him be one sided makes him a FAR LESS interesting character.
 
 Again im going to reiterate this making him more human just removes too much LAYERS.
 
 Another reason why his origin needs to be adapted is his relationship with Lex Luthor. In Smallville and other iconic comics such as Birthright, Secret Origin, and most recently Last Days of Lex. In these stories a young clark is often shown to have a brief childhood friendship with Lex. Like Clark, Lex always felt alone as a child. He was a science nut and was always interested in the larger universe of extra terrestrials and the like. People constantly saw and bullied him as a weird freak, and everytime he tried to help others people would just reject him. Clark was the only one who tolerated and protected him leading to their ""friendship""
 But Lex's obsession with the larger universe led to his failed experiment and eventual downfall. He tried to create a machine to find and/or communicate with extra terrestrial life but it exploded and almost killed a ton of people. This led to further rejection from the people of Smallville and made him think that people would always see him as a freak just because he thought bigger and wanted to create science for a better tomorrow. This rejection then of course made him angry, resentful, and didnt care who he stepped on as long as he got his way.
 
 And Clark feels guilty, because if Clark just told him who he really was then maybe Lex wouldn't have turned out evil. If Lex just had a friend who not only matched his intellect but also understood his experiences of being outcasted and then maybe, just maybe both of them together could have used their powers to save and create a better tomorrow for everyone. With this context in mind the rivalry becomes more complex. Superman isnt trying to just stop Lex simply because he's evil. He's also just trying to save his friend.
 
 There are a lot more things that i dont like in the film but this where my main points really stop. My other complaints like Jimmy not being a weird lovable dork enough (he's just too regular) and most of the Daily Planet just being caricatures of their comic selves and Clark just having one scene are all really minor nitpicks that can be solved with future movies and adventures.
 
 But again as i said in the beginning despite all my long ass complaints there's still a lot to enjoy in this film. And i cannot deny that there is clearly heart in here and is easily still the best Supes movie since Christopher Reeve. It's just the Evil Els that really ruined it for me.
 
 LASTLY Kara having a cameo at the end kinda breaks the movie in half. Like bro, if you really think the El's are evil then why do you still like your cousin? why do you still wear the House of El logo? like bro your cousin is a living example of the footage being straight up wrong lol.
 
 Look, it may look like im a hater right now but i genuinely just wanted to love this movie. There are so much scenes here that made the comic book fan in me just smile and cheer like crazy. But the flaws were just way too big for me and it really muddled my experience. I just want Superman, my favorite comic character of all time to be adapted well. And yes while this is definitely the best Adaptation since 1978, it just didn't hit for me. If you're a comic fan or just a movie fan in general im sure you'll still find enjoyment in this because the whole movie is still very fuckin endearing and action packed. But yeah for now, im sticking to the comics. Peace.",6.0
1061474,687aa32dff26beb16372bed9,r96sk,"<em>'Superman'</em> is the best Supes film that I've seen - and I highly enjoyed 2013's <em>'Man of Steel'</em>, so that is actually saying something. I was surprised at how great this 2025 edition is, like at no point was I ever doubting what I was seeing - it's a fab 2hrs.
 
 I had seen snippets from a few trailers for this and, in truth, wasn't really vibing with it back then. The lead actor seemed a bit underwhelming, the dialogue felt lousy and Lex Luthor came across over the top. I'm pleased to say, none of those things are true.
 
 David Corenswet is an ace Superman, he fits the role to perfection. Again, I did like Henry Cavill's stint as the eponymous Kryptonian, though I do reckon Corenswet does ever so slightly outdo him. It's silly of me to even compare to be honest, given my appreciation for both.
 
 For me, Nicholas Hoult is just as big a plus. This is the best of him I've seen, given I've never been fully convinced. Don't get me wrong, I've liked performances from him, but almost always with an asterisk of sorts attached in my mind. No such issues here, he is fantastic as Lex.
 
 Rachel Brosnahan and Edi Gathegi also dazzle, the latter's character is especially interesting as I never knew he existed before this - hope to see more! Anthony Carrigan, Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced also manage to stick out, which is impressive. All those onsceen are good.
 
 The story is a surpremely entertaining one. I like how they skipped over the origins of Superman, the vast majority of viewers already know the backstory so it's not needed - and for those that don't, a simple short overview, as seen here, is more than enough to get the point across.
 
 As for everthing else? The pacing, the visuals, the special effects, the music... all excellent. I, somewhat unexpectedly, have zero issues with this one, I thoroughly had fun with it and would happily revisit it at any time.",9.0
1061474,687eb1160e4818a9995291b7,MovieGuys,"Putting all else aside, James Gunn's ""Superman"" succeed's because it adopts, an all too familiar, wholly ""likeable"", approach.
 
 This film borrows heavily from the 70's Superman franchise. Its look, its feel, right down to costumes, harks back to that era. As does, the very simple, down to earth main character, capably played by  David Corenswet. I personally, could not but recall Christoper Reeve, in his performance.
 
 This is Superman as he was mean't to be. No cynicism, no divisive woke politics, just a good guy doing his best. Its this innately appealing character and those around him, that make this film function. Because lets be honest, whilst its an entertaining romp, the script is, in my estimation ""chaotic"". Its literally all over the place, doing too many things at once. That said, if you view those scenes in isolation, a good portion, are both enjoyable and amusing. For example, Lex Luthor, getting his comeuppance, from Superman's cousins, kooky Superdog. 
 
 In summary, no ""Superman"" 2025 is not a perfect film. That said, in a world that's become cynical and divisive, the simple, honest, likeability of this film shines though in a way that's impossible to ignore. For my money, well worth a look.",7.0

That’s because “Soop” (David Corensweet) recently intervened in a war to assist a small agrarian nation from being invaded by it’s nasty militarised neighbour. With access to his enormous resources, “Luthor” manages to penetrate the secret Antarctic fortress of our well-meaning protector to find not only his deepest secrets but also to kidnap his energetic dog “Krypto” - thus luring his quarry into the aforementioned “pocket universe” where the ultimate super-max prison contains many whom the planet doesn’t know what do do with any more, and a few ex-girlfriends. What chance he can escape through a complex sequence of portals (think “Stargate”)? Well that is largely down to his tenacious on/off girlfriend “Lois” (Rachel Brosnahan) who is entirely aware of her beau’s double identity, and to a tech whizz (Edi Gathegi) from another group of meta humans called the “Justice Gang” run by the “Green Lantern” who occasionally help out when the relentless stream of aliens descend on Metropolis. Now the scene is set for a really weak, repetitious and entirely derivative series of thwack and pow adventures that had me looking at the ceiling just once too often. Gene Hackman was always going to take some beating as “Luthor” but why use a British actor at all, and then make him use an entirely unnecessary American accent before giving him lines that make him sound like a frenzied bingo-caller? What’s with the dog? Aw, bless, but really? It just goes to show how remarkably ordinary “Superman” has become in a world so completely dominated by technology and people with far greater superpowers. Corensweet tries quite hard, is easy on the eye and he has some charm to him, but nobody else really has enough to get their teeth into and just by shaving Hoult’s head you don’t make him menacing. He isn’t in the least. There is cheesy sentiment all over this CGI-fest of a film that has a passing similarity to Ezra Miller’s “The Flash” from 2023. Sure, it moves along quickly but when you start to create cracks in what made a superhero super in the first place, you have to be able to infill with some serious attempts at action characterisation - not slushy dog-loving, baby/girlfriend-saving ones. No such development happens here and after the final denouement - there are a few goes at that - I left the cinema thinking this was an huge victory for style over substance and that this fella isn’t so much super as flawed: physically and emotionally. That wasn’t what I wanted to see. It’s a family film that can offend no-one and that looks great on a big screen, but I was distinctly disappointed, sorry.",6.0

That’s almost entirely down to a cheeky and engaging effort from Ben Wang as the young “Li Fong” who has recently (and reluctantly) arrived in Los Angeles from Beijing with his doctor mother (Ming-Na Wen) after a family tragedy which we go into a little more, later. He befriends pizza family “Victor” (Joshua Jackson) and his teenage daughter “Mia” (Sadie Stanley) but quickly - and quite brutally - discovers that former prize-fighting dad is in hock to a loan shark and so wants to try to punch his way out of his problems. When he realises that the young lad has some skill with kung-fu, they decide to team up and that’s the start of their escapades that ultimately pitches the new arrival against local champion “Conor” (Aramis Knight). For that challenge, he is lucky to have the help of his visiting Chinese mentor “Shifu” (Jackie Chan) who manages to elicit the assistance of the original “Karate Kid” himself (Ralph Macchio) so he may practise the more cerebral “Miyagi” form of karate. Predictable? Well, yes and Macchio is about as wooden as one of his late, lamented, master’s bonsai trees but there’s a little gentle mischief from Chan and just about enough action to stop the melodrama from swamping the thing. You will probably never recall it half an hour after you’ve seen it, but it’s is probably second to the original (1984) and passes a couple of hours effortlessly.",6.0

 I didn’t like this. That said, my only frame of reference for The Karate Kid is that one How I Met Your Mother episode, so I haven’t seen the original films. But because I know how much people hype this franchise and how beloved it is, I went in expecting a lot. I expected phenomenal karate choreography, some intense emotional moments, and real substance.
 Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I don’t think I’m the target audience for this film, honestly, it didn’t feel like it was made for me, which is absolutely fine. It lacked depth, it didn’t have the emotional or narrative weight I was hoping for, and the overall vibe just didn’t land with me. The Karate Kid: Legends wasn’t for me.

It is not just nostalgia—it is the way those earlier stories balanced conflict discipline, and standing for what is right. This version feels like a toned down version. It is not strong enough to stand beside the classics either.

541671,684ab3484a3e44cf68293ebc,CinemaSerf,"This isn’t a film, it’s a live action video game with a predictable plot and loads of energetically choreographed CGI to substitute for anything vaguely akin to a story. It starts with the young “Eve” (Victoria Comte) who witnesses her father’s death at the hands of “The Chancellor” (Gabriel Byrne) before being adopted into the secret society of “John Wick” by “Winston” (Ian McShane) and his drag-like boss (Angelica Huston) where she learns to combine the artistic skills of a ballerina with deadly ninja ones - as she morphs into Ana de Armas (whilst everyone else remains exactly the same). Anyway, none of that really matters as she accidentally discovers the identity of the tribe who ruined her life and despite warnings of dire consequences, sets off on a lethal mission of retribution that takes her to a Czech Republic where everyone speaks perfect English. The thing is, it appears that her gang and the one she is pursuing have a sort of unwritten truce, and given she is about to throw that under the Skoda, Angelica has no choice other than to bring out of retirement the legendary you know who. Will that make anything any different or safer or even less repetitive? It not so much that this is derivative and really quite dull, it’s that the dialogue is woeful and the constant frying pan to fire scenarios where people get used and abused are ridiculous. Knives, guns, bottles, pots, pans, kettles - even a pair of ruthlessly applied roller skates and some flamer throwers help our heroine along but it’s hilarious that they always appear just when she needs them. She’s got the points and gone up a level, She also heals as if she were the sister of “Wolverine” and no amount of training is going to remove a six inch shard of glass from your body without it impeding your ability to scale a wall and wield a pick axe. Maybe I just wasn’t in the mood, but just like the series upon which this is based, it is unoriginal and after the umpteenth time she has survived against innumerable odds to fight again just had me wondering how long until she’s back with “Ballerina II - the Pirouette”.

The movie is quite a simple vengeance story at the center which is sadly left unfulfilled but it is how well every other element of the movie is taken that makes this story actually work at the end of the day. The action is the same John Wick action we know and love but with so much more creativity infused this time around, from people popping like a balloon by way of grenade to people being lit on fire like crazy. This different approach to the action of the main John Wick films, which is often cold and very mechanical, makes Ballerina stand out on its own. Of course, _Ballerina_ also stands out because of the committed efforts of Ana de Armas as Eve who the audience actually gets to care for in the movie. That's why John Wick's inclusion here seems like a massive 4th wall break because the audience is locked into Eve and her vengeful mission. Other flaws of this movie lie in character development, balance, motivation, and redemption but also in short plot points and vague plot points. Lastly, the world building in _Ballerina_ is a healthy amount, especially for a spin-off film, making the movie that much more interesting. _Ballerina_ is another stellar addition to the John Wick universe that I hope has legs to continue in the future.",8.0

1234821,6869d736dc61d3bf9653f7ef,Brent Marchant,"Sometimes movies have a way of surprising us in unexpectedly pleasant ways. And this latest installment in the “Jurassic” franchise is just such a case. Admittedly, I had more than a few reservations going into this one; I couldn’t help but think that this was a cinematic commodity that had run its course, that it was essentially out of gas to offer anything new of genuine value, and, to a certain degree, that’s true, at least where originality is concerned. However, despite the picture’s expected plunge into familiar territory, director Gareth Edwards’s latest feature offering is nevertheless highly entertaining, even if not particularly groundbreaking. Perhaps that rests with the fact that this is arguably the most Spielbergian installment in the series, in many ways reflective of the iconic production that launched the franchise in 1993. In yet another story involving self-serving agenda-driven characters placing themselves in tremendous peril by venturing into a world of dangerous, genetically manipulated dinosaurs recklessly brought back to life for profit and entertainment purposes, the film follows a narrative formula that most viewers will find more than a little recognizable. But what helps to set this installment apart from many of its predecessors is the quality of the filmmaking itself, specifically its ability to effectively build and maintain tension, its capacity for presenting story arc elements in fresh and inventive ways, and its overall production values, most notably its fine (and occasionally unanticipated) special effects and its efforts in upping the talent quotient of the cast with such commendable additions as Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali. Most importantly, though, this offering is to be applauded for its continuity in staying on track in terms of tone, self-aware of what kind of a movie it truly wants to be. This differentiates “Rebirth” from many of its previous releases, which often couldn’t decide whether they wanted to tell bona fide sci-fi-based tales or present themselves as campy romps (as seen, for example, in the now-famous (or is it infamous?) Bryce Dallas Howard high heel sequences in the first “Jurassic World” offering (2015)). What’s more, Spielberg’s influence in bringing this production to life is clearly present in the finished product, both in terms of honoring the merits of the series’ premiere installment, as well as in its respectful homages to the auteur’s classic 1975 offering, “Jaws.” To be sure, there are some aspects here that are wholly predictable (such as little doubt as to which characters will be offed and when), and there are times when the pacing could stand to be brisker, particularly when the film strives (sometimes a little too hard) to invoke a greater degree of character depth and development than what has typically been the case in previous “Jurassic” releases. In addition, the picture suffers from occasional plot holes, several contrived narrative devices (including one egregiously silly element near the film’s outset that nearly cost me my hopes for the remainder of the release) and more than a little blatantly shameless product placement shots. On balance, though, this is a surprisingly good picture in a series that’s now seven installments deep, an accomplishment that few franchises (other than the “Star Trek” and “007” series) can boast. Don’t be too quick to sell this one short; it may not be perfect, but it’s certainly enjoyable summertime action-adventure fare that makes for a good time on a lazy Saturday afternoon when you don’t feel like going outside to brave the heat.",7.0
1234821,686e652169fa3110009a4dd4,CinemaSerf,"Well at least there is one scene where huge great dinosaurs walk, accompanied by John Williams’s original theme, to remember - but otherwise this is a really disappointing video-game of a film that offers us nothing at all that the Jurassic franchise hasn’t already. By now, these great creatures have largely been taken care of by Mother Nature and have been reduced to living in small groups in equatorial zones around the world where they just want to be left alone to eat and be eaten, protected from a humanity which is “expressly” prohibited from going there. The grasping “Krebs” (Rupert Friend - Orlando Bloom must have been busy) has a plan to cure heart disease and so recruits special ops veteran “Zora” (Scarlett Johansson) to help him secure the living DNA from three of the greatest of these creatures. They wouldn’t know one if they saw one though, so have to convince the nerdy scientist “Loomis” (Jonathan Bailey) to accompany them and their local fixer “Kincaid” (Mahershala Ali) and they head deep into these deadly waters. Meantime, a family are blithely sailing from Bermuda to Cape Town, apparently unaware of the dangers posed by these Vernian monsters. They are dad, young daughter, hormonal older daughter and her bone idle boyfriend, “Xavier” (David Iacono). Boy are they in for a shock when they cross some huge great, and angry, Mosasaurus and end up with most of their boat pointing the wrong way in the water, but with “Xavier” still able to catch some rays whilst they await rescue from, well you can guess who comes, and largely what happens from here on in. For much of the movie, we have two parallel storylines to underwhelm us: the unarmed yet remarkably resilient family have to find an abandoned HQ whilst the mercenaries play a sort of level-by-level game navigating the usual island full of beasties adventures that haven’t really advanced much since it’s nearest biological cousin - “Jurassic Park III” (2001). Oddly enough, I didn’t think these visual effects were anywhere near as effective as in the originals. Maybe we are all just too used to these great animals lumbering about on land, breaching like whales at sea, or swooping and pecking relentlessly from the air? Johansson does join in enthusiastically and Jonathan Bailey really has one one of those smiles on his face that suggests he is enjoying his days in front of the green screen knowing it has to be easier than singing “Not Getting Married” on stage eight times a week - and probably better paid. The others really only make up the numbers, though, with a few characters obviously designated as dino-fodder early-on as it rehashes scenarios from just about everything from “Indian Jones” to “Harry Potter”. It might be like comparing apples and pears, but I have to say I found the current “How to Train Your Dragon” a much more enjoyable adventure about man’s relationship with thick-skinned, scaly, predators, because this entirely forgettable film will do little more than slot nicely into the Christmas television schedules with little, if anything, to distinguish about it once it’s grand scale cinema run has concluded.

 1. Rumi was born part-demon, right? Her mother was a demon hunter and her father was a demon, which implies that not all demons are evil, right? Yes? No? We are never told how Rumi's mother died and we are never told what happened to Rumi's father, but I highly doubt that Rumi's mother was tricked into a relationship by a demon long enough to have a child.

986056,6812a407a679bc354002071e,Chris Sawin,"Directed by Jake Schreier (Netflix’s Beef, Showtime’s Kidding) and written by Eric Pearson (Transformers One, Black Widow) and Joanna Calo (The Bear, Bojack Horseman), Thunderbolts* documents the emptiness surrounding Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) as she goes through the motions while working for the Ox Group led by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus).
 
 Yelena still hasn’t recovered from Natasha/Black Widow’s death and is sick of killing people and doing villainous tasks for money. After a visit with her father figure Alexai Shostakov (David Harbour), Yelena decides to go straight and attempt to be a hero.
 
 Unfortunately for her, de Fontaine is currently being investigated by the government and is on the verge of being impeached. Yelena’s last job is just an excuse for de Fontaine to tie up all her loose ends and appear innocent. Yelena finds herself trapped in a giant incinerator with U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), and a man plagued with memory loss named Bob (Lewis Pullman).
 
 Thunderbolts* is a strange superhero film for a variety of reasons. The antihero dynamic already gives the film a dysfunctional Guardians of the Galaxy/Suicide Squad appeal, where a bunch of outcasts find refuge and redemption by working together as a team. But the film’s writing is interesting because Thunderbolts* doesn’t feature traditional character development. What these characters share is loss.
 
 In a reveal that is likely not difficult to figure out, there’s more to Bob than Thunderbolts* lets on. Without fully spoiling the direction the film goes in with the character, Bob is able to see someone’s memories with physical touch. While this results in some interesting reveals from certain character’s pasts, it never really gets too deep even when Bob decides to share a bit more about what he’s gone through.
 
 With Bob’s ability to enter people’s minds at will, the finale of Thunderbolts* has an Inception kind of element to it, but is more of a battle with inner demons than it is an all out CGI slugfest. The Thunderbolts* crash through dream barriers that alter physics while transitioning to whichever character is taking the lead in the sequence (the film typically goes back and forth between Yelena and Bob).
 
 But the uniting of these characters still rides on trauma and loss. Yelena is searching for something to fill the emptiness inside of her. Alexei hasn’t been Red Guardian since the events of Black Widow and now drives a red limo for a job. He has completely lost whatever remained of his already dwindling super-soldier status.
 
 Ghost no longer struggles to control her powers or her molecular status, but she does struggle with finding a purpose in this film. Apart from fighting and bickering with everyone, Ghost doesn’t add much to the film.
 
 U.S. Agent is in denial about no longer being Captain America. He acts like he has everything going for him, but has initially lost everything after the events of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is on the verge of losing everything she’s been trying to build. Bob has always been alone. He’s never had friends and the void that has left inside him is quite literally a plot device for later in the film.
 
 Bucky (Sebastian Stan) has been dabbling in Congress, but he’s kind of floundered around since Sam Wilson became the new Captain America. He’s not so secretly a part of the de Fontaine impeachment investigation and is searching for some sort of concrete evidence the only way The Winter Soldier can.
 
 The film’s entertainment value is mostly invested in how unlikely this group of outcasts and shoehorned “heroes” are when they’re all trapped together in the same building. They initially start off being too stubborn to work together and it’s only once they learn how flawed the other costumed individuals are around them do they start to actually make a decent team.
 
 There isn’t a ton of depth to Thunderbolts*, but it’s fun for what it is and is much more enjoyable than Captain America: Brave New World. The film is mostly setting up a new Avengers-like team for the next phase of the MCU although Sam Wilson’s Captain America is doing something similar. The film is purely worth seeing for Bob. The character has serious potential and Lewis Pullman has a clueless charm in his performance that coincides with one of the most powerful characters in the MCU.
 
 Thunderbolts* is loaded with ass-kicking awesomeness. Florence Pugh is outstanding and Bob is the coolest character to come along in the MCU in a long, long time. Antiheroes are finally fun again.",7.0

 The Vault escape sequence was funny and memorable, capturing the chaotic spirit and humorous banter between the team. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine makes a standout villain, she was clever, cunning, and convincingly evil.
 
 The character dynamics were great. Yelena Belova anchors the film emotionally, while Bucky Barnes feels more relatable and likeable than ever. Bob was a fun addition, bringing subtle humor and a few standout moments that added to the story's emotional beats and brought a few moments of intensity. The rest of the Thunderbolts comprising of Red Guardian, Ghost and U. S. Agent also shine, creating a team that's messy, fun, and surprisingly easy to root for.
 
 Director Jake Schreier manages to strike a perfect balance between emotion, humor, and action, giving the film real heart amid the excitement. Although the ending was a bit unusual, it worked well. You could call the ending and the movie as a whole, bold, creative, and definitely memorable.

 ""Thunderbolts* is an exceptional superhero movie precisely because it focuses on a deep exploration of human fragility. Prioritizing its broken protagonists' internal struggles over pure audiovisual spectacle shows a rare maturity in a franchise often criticized for sacrificing substance in favor of generic scale.
 
 This bold approach allows the cast to shine - Florence Pugh especially, who firmly establishes herself as one of the MCU's core pillars. By exploring themes like depression, grief, abandonment, and reconnection with honesty and care, Jake Schreier transforms a blockbuster into a poignant meditation on shared purpose and what it means to live with open wounds.
 
 In a landscape flooded with recycled formulas, Marvel has delivered something courageously human - making this Phase Five closing piece not only one of the year's biggest surprises but also one of the most emotionally resonant entries in the entire cinematic universe.""

 ... nothing in the movie made us really interested in the movie we were watching.  A lot happens that the plot demands happen.  There's a lot of conveniences that are nicely peppered throughout the film that the protagonists can use because it's necessary for the plot.
 
 I get the the feeling that the characters are from other Marvel shows, most of which my wife and I never cared to watch or just gave up on after the first couple of episodes.

986056,6816b0c719ceb3248df482a1,Brent Marchant,"Superheroes are supposed to be special, gifted individuals, so it logically follows that movies about them should be equally special. However, as has become all too apparent in recent years, that quality has been steadily eroding in these films due to oversaturation in the cinematic marketplace, a circumstance that naturally begs the question, how special (i.e., how different or distinguished) can they really be when there are so many of them? Sadly, that's the key issue weighing down this latest release in the Marvel Universe. Even though the film serves as an introduction to a new slate of Marvel superheroes, the picture isn't particularly groundbreaking given the many similar offerings that have preceded it in this genre. Despite this film's few minor modifications to an otherwise-formulaic and shopworn narrative, in many respects, the picture's story feels like it's been cobbled together from elements in other superhero adventures. For instance, the band of heroes here consists largely of a collection of courageous misfits reminiscent of releases in the ""Suicide Squad"" franchise. Then there are the nerdy sidekicks, who feel like they've been culled from the ""Deadpool"" pictures. And the primary challenge these characters face comes from the threat of dubious weaponized technology wielded by a power-hungry leader, a scenario at the heart of films like ""X-men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) and ""Logan"" (2017). This patchwork of elements consequently makes for a plotline that frequently feels forced and somewhat disjointed yet also ultimately predictable. Its few departures from the tried and true, while modestly interesting, feel as though they've been included to silence critics as supposed evidence of the production's efforts to incorporate fresh new material. To its credit, ""Thunderbolts*"" features some genuinely funny comic relief and commendable performances by Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, though the action sequences come across as a little stale and the unimpressive CGI effects could use some shoring up. Director Jake Schreier does a capable job of doing what this film was essentially designed to do - give diehard Marvel fans another fix of what they truly crave. And that's fine as far as it goes. But, in terms of its contributions to the annals of filmdom, this is far from memorable filmmaking, especially in terms of originality. After all, cookie cutters are supposed to be used for making baked goods, not movies.",6.0

Went in with pretty low expectations—thought it’d be just another filler Marvel movie—but it actually exceeded them by a lot. The characters had solid chemistry, the action was tight, and there were a few emotional moments that caught me off guard (in a good way). It’s definitely not your typical superhero team-up; felt a little grittier and more grounded.

986056,681b079f2fb54da99c8092e6,CinemaSerf,"Hats off to Florence Pugh for injecting some charisma into this film, but otherwise I found it to be little different from the latest slew of “save the planet” Marvel adventures that follows a predictable pattern of escaping from the frying pan into the fire a few times before it culminates in a proud declaration that a new franchise has been born. It turns out that “Yelena” (Pugh) has been working for years as an assassin for the “Val” (Julia-Louise Dreyfus) whose director of the CIA seems to have been running unfettered off-the-books projects around the globe trying to impose her own brand of world order. The US Congress is breathing down her neck, now, though - so it is time to eliminate all the loose ends. Of course, that doesn’t quite go to plan and instead of disposing of the incriminating evidence, she merely galvanises an unlikely team of erstwhile employees of the agency to wreak their own vengeance. Meantime, the former “Winter Soldier” has got himself elected to the House and is now determined to work with those impeaching “Val” to bring her to book. Looks like “Buckie” (Sebastian Stan) might have to join this disparate group as it becomes clear that one of their number, the unassuming and pyjama-clad “Bob” (Lewis Pullman) might have more in common with “Brightburn” than “Superman”. What now ensues is the usual team-building exercise as they learn to trust each other, reveal secrets from their typically troubled pasts and, of course, kick some ass. David Harbour enthusiastically delivers his “Red Guardian” character, as does the very slightly menacing Pugh, but the others in the gang are all instantly forgettable and though ostensibly darker than many of its contemporaries, it still suffers from the perennial problem facing the whole MCU: they tee up these baddies with overwhelming psychological and physical prowess and yet you always know there will be sunlit uplands at the end. Stick around til the very end of the credits, though, for perhaps the most poignant part of this film. It is, after all, all about who sells the brand.",6.0

 Action: 10/10 - The choreography is realistic and different for each character. There are many a gun fight, with explosions out the wazoo. The best thing, there isn't a sky beam at the end.
 
 Writing: 10/10 - Nothing feels rushed, it's well paced, and the characters appear to develop throughout the story.
 
 Acting: 08/10 - Yelena and Bob have some of the best and most relatable dialogue, and the actors do a great job portraying the characters emotion.
 
 Casting: 10/10 - Everyone looks like they could be their respective characters. Yelena appears as if she could have come from the Red Room. Red Guardian looks like he's still tough, but hasn't been in the action for a while. The same goes for Bucky.
 
 Humor: 08/10 - The comedy of Red Guardian is something almost no one can surpass, which is not to say the other characters aren't funny. While sometimes their comedic timing is off, I bet you'll laugh a few times. 
 
 Message: 10/10 - The concept of mental health is something that is constantly brought up in this movie. Yelena feels unfulfilled and is doing these jobs as a distraction, and Bob is stuck in his own darkness. The concept of heading for the light, rather than the darkness, is the main message in this movie. With that said, if you pay close attention, you'll leave, having learned something about mental health.

I was expecting this to pack a bit more of a punch in terms of humour, but it is certainly still a movie I'd count as enjoyable. The main reason for that is the cast, all of whom manage to deliver a satisfactory performance.
 
 With that said, Florence Pugh is the clear standout in my opinion. Lewis Pullman is solid in his role, the same can be said about Sebastian Stan. I personally wanted to see more of David Harbour, he is certainly the most amusing of those that make an appearance in thsi 2025 flick.
 
 Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a bit underwelming, mind you. I don't think the character is interesting enough to feature so heavily and to be quite as instrumental in the plot as de Fontaine ends up being. I'm fairly certain I'll struggle to remember Dreyfus' part in this in the future.",7.0

Never aging, cutting the lawn, getting skin cancer, missing that catch in little league. Make Homelander black again.
 
 The twist is everyone sucks worse than their counterpart. I thought this movie would suck worse than watching 3 shitty Captain Americas, 1 sexy Nightcrawler and 1 young Black Widow fight crime. But, they support crime while they support each other to face their personal failures and find redemption through positive action! Elaine does well as Vought CEO, the humour well integrated and enough things happen to fill the run time which is short in comparison.

Yep - I’d probably just quietly put a pillow over her head one night, too. Luckily, “Stefani” (Kaitlyn Santa Reyes) gets to go home and try to get to the bottom of things. When she mentions this to her family, it turns out that the dream has it’s roots in fact and that is all comes down to whacky grandma “Iris” (Gabrielle Rose) who lives in a remote location that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a “Mad Max” movie and who has her own theory about just what happened on that very night, fifty years ago, and about death. As with the other “Final Destination” series, death is much more of an animate object with a plan, a scheme and boy does it not like it when a plan doesn’t come together. Pretty swiftly, the young lass concludes that over the intervening years the grim reaper has been settling scores and now it is the turn of her family. They all think she’s bonkers, but when their attitudinal cousin “Erik” (Richard Harmon) finds himself having an exceptionally narrow escape, they begin to sit up and take notice. Thing is, though, do they seriously think they can thwart the original man with the scythe? You know that expression about a moth fluttering it’s wings by the Amazon and there being an tsunami in Sri Lanka? Well some of the deathly cause and effect scenarios here are just as entertainingly far fetched as we learn to appreciate the terrors of some otherwise benign garden implements, a nose-ring and a rusty old weathervane - to name but a few instruments - that can be used to facilitate our always brutal and gory journey to the hereafter. The disasters-in-waiting are all fairly visually teed up for us, so we can anticipate the grizzle before it inevitably occurs - but what we can’t always do is anticipate just how these incidents will pan out. Death may have a plan, but it’s an adaptable one and as the family start to dwindle in typically slasher-horror fashion we are able to pick out favourites (mine was the annoying “Aunt Brenda” (April Talek)) and hope that they might be next! This is enjoyable stuff that needs to be watched in the spirit intended. No, the script isn’t up to much nor are any of the standard acting performances from the Blumhouse book of scream then run before making implausible decisions and ending up - well you know how that usually pans out.

574475,68269ad94918f4ee1b315acc,r96sk,"<em>'Final Destination Bloodlines'</em> is unexpectedly terrific. I watched the original five movies two months ago and highly enjoyed the first flick, though the subsequent follow-ups weren't the best (though I did like <em>'Final Destination 5'</em>). This is the best sequel, no doubt.
 
 What I wanted going in was mindless fun and cool deaths. For me, it ticked both of those boxes with full conviction. I think I gained entertainment from every offing, which is pleasing. They are very nicely done, rather creative too. I'm sure the plot has holes, but honestly... <a href=""https://youtu.be/RsYi2VH2y6U?si=EYdGbleQqyzUPFt6&t=2"" rel=""nofollow""><i>""we don't care""</i></a>.
 
 The cast are all pleasing, there isn't anyone who blew me away or anything but I did really enjoy those onscreen here. Kaitlyn Santa Juana is the standout, but Gabrielle Rose, Richard Harmon and the rest (I see you, Teo Briones of <em>'Chucky'</em>) are all good value. The special effects are satisfying, as well.
 
 I will state that the film is possibly more funny than I think it intends to be, which isn't a bad thing whatsoever for me but I did sense it wasn't quite intending to be as amusing as it is in parts; even if they are, of course, going for laughs still. Maybe I'm wrong. All's well that ends well, either way.
 
 I'd rank this higher than the original. There isn't much in it, but this does narrowly outdo that one in my opinion.

 On the upside acting is competent, the story-line predictable but polished, with believable, relatable, characterisations. There's also a competently handled dose of sixties nostalgia, that taps into the kinds of fears anyone who has  eaten at a revolving restaurant, perched atop a tall tower, might entertain. Having eaten at two, one in Hong Kong and another in China, myself, this felt familiar and did make me chuckle (nervously).
 
 Where I believe, this film falls down, is it could have crafted, cunningly clever kills, without the need to make them gratuitous. I found this aspect of the film, off putting and I probably wont watch another, for this reason. Its cheap, tasteless, sensationalist and frankly, unnecessarily degrades, what otherwise, could have been an eerily entertaining experience.

 This iteration nails everything, from the tremendous opening sequence to the gory, creative, often hilarious death sequences, and sprinkles in a few other cameos you may recognize if you're familiar with the series.
 
 It also throws a few curve balls to keep things interesting, and I definitely wasn't expecting the soundtrack to contain banger after banger nor for the jokes to land so well, but the writers knocked it out of the park. 
 
 The only downer is that Tony Todd is clearly in his last days, and if you're a horror fan, that was tough to see. I'm just glad he got to do what he loved until the very end.

There is no mystery, no real tension, one or two ""surprising"" revelations, and very little to hang on to. Even with a half-functioning brain, this film won't be distracting enough to warrant its full attention.

 ""The Old Guard 2 is a mixed bag - a sequel that improves in some areas but regresses in others. Its action remains entertaining, bolstered by committed performances and sharp choreography. Thematically, it dares to ask meaningful questions about destiny, power, and morality, even if it struggles to answer them in a satisfying manner.
 
 But a sluggish pace, tonal inconsistencies, and an overemphasis on setting up future installments dilute what could have been a sharper, more impactful story. Fans of the first film might find enough to enjoy, but it's hard to shake the feeling that this franchise is losing sight of what made it special in the first place.

 Lets start with the positives. Idris Elba and John Cena are perfect choices for this kind of film. Ones loud, a showman, in the role of the US president. The other's more grounded and somewhat acerbic, as the UK Prime Minister. The interplay between the two works well, moving from mutual disdain, to at times grudging, respect and even friendship, of a kind. 
 
 The action is well paced too, it keeps coming with a little mostly light drama, in between, so you can catch your breath. 
 
 Now to the downside. They can play this any way they like but its hard not to see elements of pro US/UK political and military propaganda, in operation. NATO are heavily pushed as the ""good guys"", taking on ""bullies"". Well tell that to the former Yugoslavia NATO bombed into the ground and ultimately, destroyed. Its unsurprising too, that the ""baddies""are portrayed as Russian.

It just all felt so plain, stale and quite grating, to be honest. To my surprise, though, it actually improved as it went on. By the end, I think it actually won me over.
 
 One element that was keeping my interest, even amongst the aforementioned slow initial chunk, was the cast. I like Idris Elba, I like John Cena. Therefore, I had just enough in me to keep my eyes on the screen. Their banter is a bit forced, but does become effective eventually.
 
 Priyanka Chopra is pretty good, plenty of satisfactory action from her; that recap edit is amusingly done, to be fair. Jack Quaid's bit is fun, while Paddy Considine, Stephen Root and Carla Gugino are decent actors to compensate for otherwise quite lame characters.
 
 If not for those named, I'd be rating this a lot lower. Still, there are some strong moments and cool shots in there, like the apartment staircase and the lost tooth moment. Annoyingly, there is a fair amount wrong too; for example, the special effects are absolutely not good.

His remaining driver is British rookie “Joshua” (Damson Idris) but he’s nowhere near experienced enough to make any impact on the problem. For that, he needs to coax back “Sonny” (Brad Pitt) who did drive these cars twenty years ago but hung up his helmet after an accident and then became an itinerant driver eking a living across the USA.

Indeed, I could cheerfully have lived without the dramatic characterisation here altogether, and just stuck to the tensely directed and really compelling action sequences that, especially using the in-car cameras, is genuinely quite exciting to watch. You really do get a sense of the speed of the cars racing round the tracks and of the phenomenal engineering that goes into the design and manufacture of these cars that at times look no more substantial than an Airfix kit. Pitt is in his element here delivering a character that’s a lovable rogue meets smug git whilst Idris comes across entirely naturally as the youngster out of his depth but willing and determined to learn. The soundtrack from the likes of Queen and Led Zeppelin livens up what I’d have to say isn’t Hans Zimmer’s most memorable score, and with the last half hour largely devoid of the romantic and emotional clutter, we watch something that shows us this circus in full pomp.

Now we know a little more about that that the enforcers do, and that helps tee this story up for quite a dramatic ending that tests loyalty, trust and friendships across the board as peril ebbs ever closer and the monsters starts to acquire some distinctly zombie traits. This is a solidly executed and quickly paced adventure that spends a little time building on the characters (from a previous series) but for the most part  just engages us in an action-packed squash the baddies festival with plenty of squelching and loads of gunge and goo covering the streets as and “Kaiju” and the buildings end up collateral damage during the battles. There’s a bit of sarcasm hidden in the dialogue which I quite liked, and the messages of team playing, inter-reliance and of age not necessarily being a barrier to attaining your goals are here but not laboured. Stick around after the credits, there’s another twenty minutes or so (from the next series) that serves to humanise some of these folks, and if you’re looking for a colourfully vibrant series of shoot/slice/blow ‘em ups, then this is for you.

 What it is is a two-hour philosophical journey on the themes of self-worth, value, and materialism through the lens of three very flawed characters.

1136867,686667e5369d92f48631fa25,Manuel São Bento,"Celine Song's Materialists is a stunningly mature, emotionally intelligent romantic drama, one that redefines the very concept of modern love without falling into the usual pitfalls of the genre. Anchored by three outstanding performances, Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal share extraordinary chemistry that feels raw, layered, and heartbreakingly authentic. Song's screenplay dissects with surgical precision the transactional nature of today's dating world, where intangible values like affection and vulnerability often struggle against the ever-growing checklist of material, social, and political boxes. Money, body image, height, political leanings - even something as seemingly trivial as the texture of one's hair - are thoughtfully explored as factors that, in theory, should dictate compatibility. But through intimate silences, aching glances, and conversations that pierce right through the soul, Song reminds us that love, in all its flawed, inexplicable glory, cannot be quantified.
 
 Technically, Materialists is a masterclass in restraint. There's barely a musical score to be found, allowing every silence, every breath, and every hesitant word to carry the full weight of the characters' feelings. The cinematography makes the bold, unconventional choice to focus on the listener rather than the speaker, granting the audience rare insight into the unsaid, the reactions that words alone can't convey. Lingering shots in moments of silence exude not only tension but a rare, electric chemistry between the characters. The film crafts its emotional crescendo without a single moment of forced dramatization, making the eventual choices of Johnson's character feel entirely organic. Song bravely avoids providing easy answers: there's no judgment, no clear winner in the love triangle. Whether one follows love with all its imperfections, as in the Dakota-Evans connection, or chooses the materially perfect partner lacking in emotional spark, as represented by Pascal's character, Materialists argues that either path is valid - and equally human.
 
 If there's one area where Song perhaps leans too heavily, it's in the recurring client interviews of Johnson's character, which, while often sharp and humorous, begin to border on repetitive. The thematic point about society's shallow dating expectations lands early on, and a couple of these scenes feel like they're spelling out what the rest of the movie has already conveyed so gracefully. But this minor excess does little to detract from the overall impact. Materialists stands as one of the finest romantic dramas in recent memory, brilliantly avoiding the traps of cliché and formula. It's a profoundly insightful exploration of why we fall in love, and how that choice - no matter how irrational, imperfect, or impractical - might be the truest thing about us.

1151031,683c555f7f95d35c317ba7a6,Chris Sawin,"From Australian twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou (Talk to Me), Bring Her Back follows brother and sister Andy (Billy Barratt) and Piper (Sora Wong). Piper is mostly blind (she can see shapes and colors) and Andy has taken care of her for as long as they can both remember.
 
 When Andy and Piper’s father dies suddenly, they are adopted by a woman named Laura (Sally Hawkins). Laura has a mute son named Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips) and had a daughter who was also blind and is still grieving her death.
 
 What begins as an awkward transition during tragedy becomes an abhorrent struggle for survival as Andy and Piper eventually uncover what Laura has planned for them.
 
 Talk to Me was a riveting horror debut by the Philippou brothers/RackaRacka and had the benefit of being injected with the incredible concept of chasing the high that comes with being possessed. Bring Her Back is a bit more familiar as it deals with a woman attempting to bring her daughter back to life in the body of a similar vessel.
 
 Cinematographer Aaron McLiskey and sound effects editors Lachlan Harris and Lee Yee deserve a ton of credit for making certain elements of Bring Her Back look and feel like someone with impaired vision is experiencing them.
 
 Visually, the film often focuses on what’s taking place in the foreground while the background is blurry with just enough movement for the brain to piece together what’s occurring. When Piper and Andy are in Wendy’s (Sally-Anne Upton) office, the woman in charge of placing them in the foster care system, the first thing you see and hear are the bracelets on Wendy’s wrist as she types.
 
 In the sequence when Andy is driving Piper to Laura’s house for the first time the visor is down during a sunny day. Andy notices that Piper can’t see or feel the warm color of the day and puts the visor up, which sees an immediate change in Piper’s behavior and body language.
 
 Andy and Piper find their deceased father in the shower, which results in Andy having a traumatic response to showers throughout the rest of the film. During their father’s wake and every time Andy considers taking a shower, Andy has a panic attack. Andy breathes heavily and understandably looks shaken during these sequences, but it’s highlighted by the way the sounds of the world are muffled by his accelerating heartbeat.
 
 The concept of the film is that the living situation with Laura is meant to only be a temporary thing. In three months, Andy will be old enough to apply to be Piper’s guardian. Laura, who has slowly been figuring out a way to bring her daughter back this whole time seemingly waiting for a blind girl to end up in the local foster system, meets the siblings with mind games the minute they walk in the door.
 
 Like Talk to Me, Bring Her Back is jarring and relentless at times with unsettling moments going a step beyond what would be physically comfortable. Oliver’s moment in the kitchen with the knife is a solid example. The highlight of the film is Sally Hawkins's performance. Hawkins has never shied away from challenging films, but Bring Her Back is her first interaction with the genre and she delivers in every way imaginable.
 
 Laura is a nasty character with one goal in mind and Hawkins's performance blurs the line between pure terror and actual empathy for her. While Laura downright murders people in Bring Her Back and commits all these heinous acts, she is still a mother who has never gotten over losing the person she cared about the most in this world. And part of you still feels sorry for her by the end of the film.
 
 The juxtaposition of what Laura is presenting as a seemingly caring foster mother and the dark ritual she’s planning for Piper is somewhat disappointing. Knowing Laura’s intentions so early on in the film (it’s given away in the title and all of the marketing of the film) makes some of the slower moments in the film feel a bit longer than they should. How the film slowly reveals what’s going on with Oliver is a bit more satisfying.
 
 There’s a palpable tension early on where Laura seems like she could either be a gypsy-like character that dabbles in some sort of dark arts or just has a weird infatuation with the dead but cares about the well-being of Andy and Piper. Riding that tension a little bit longer where the film could have felt like it could have gone either way may have had a better payoff. It feels like modern horror films, especially the ones from this year, give a peek behind the curtain too soon and you’re left riding this varying wave of monotony.
 
 Bring Her Back is another mesmerizing effort from the Phillipou brothers with gnarly sequences that teeter on being fully gruesome. Sally Hawkins portrays a nurturing nightmare of a motherly figure to terrifying perfection.",8.0

 The story? Oh my gosh, the story! It was so clever and well-crafted. It had twists and turns I never saw coming, but it all made perfect sense in the end. It was like a puzzle that slowly came together, and every piece was perfectly placed. You know when a movie makes you think? This one definitely did that. It wasn't just mindless action or fluff; it had real substance.
 
 And the characters! They were so real and relatable. I felt like I knew them, like I was right there with them on their journey. They had depth, they had flaws, they had moments that made me laugh, and moments that made me want to cry. I was completely invested in what happened to them. The actors did an amazing job bringing them to life. You could feel their emotions through the screen.
 
 Visually, it was stunning. The way it was shot, the colors, the sets – everything was just beautiful. It wasn't just pretty to look at, though; it also added to the story and the mood. Some scenes were so powerful, they'll stay with me for a long time. The music was also perfect! It really enhanced the emotions and made everything even more impactful.
 
 Honestly, I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about this movie. It had everything: a great story, amazing characters, beautiful visuals, and a fantastic soundtrack. It made me feel so many different things, and it left me thinking long after it was over. If you're looking for a movie that will take you on a journey and leave you completely satisfied, this is it.

575265,68326c28079a42e287036d87,Brent Marchant,"Whenever a film playing in theaters is introduced by one of the members of the picture’s creative team, it’s a safe bet that it doesn’t live up to its pre-release hype. (Indeed, in all the years I’ve watched movies theatrically, that’s been the case every time with just two exceptions.) And, regrettably, that’s very much the case in this final installment in this long-running franchise. To put it simply, “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” is an offering with a lot of problems, the biggest of which being the decision to split the story into two parts in the first place. As it stands, the narrative could have easily been condensed down to a single release. But, if the producers truly wanted to make two films to close out the franchise, they could have readily done so by making two distinct stand-alone pictures instead of trying to tie this offering to its predecessor, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One” (2023), considering that the nexus between them is tepid at best. As a consequence, though, this two-film package makes for a needlessly long 5½-hour story that could have been told in much less time with some judicious editing. This suggests that milking the box office had to have been a strong incentive for how this project ultimately played out. And, even if that wasn’t the case, the least the creators could have done was to tell a better story: While the first part did a reasonably capable job of holding viewer interest, that’s out the window here with its many well-crafted but decidedly overlong action sequences (a la the most recent “Indiana Jones” offering (2023)); a story that elevates comparatively minor characters to unexplained relevance; under-utilizes the talents of several gifted cast members (e.g., Nick Offerman and Janet McTeer) while leaving others out entirely (where’s Vanesa Kirby’s White Widow, a character who played a key role in the first part?); and requires comprehensive audience familiarity with both the franchise’s complete mythology, as well as in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of AI technology. Most importantly, however, many plot elements of the picture go beyond being “impossible” to “wholly implausible” or even “difficult to accept,” with numerous scenes that are full of holes, rely on convenient contrivances or seem completely unfathomable. “Final Reckoning” even “borrows” elements from other movie narratives (most notably “Fail Safe” (1964) and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991)) that strain its efforts at originality. There’s also an almost self-congratulatory aspect to the production thanks to the inclusion of numerous flashback clips to previous installments in the franchise, introduced with somewhat tangential tie-ins, a cinematic stroll down memory lane that adds little (the film’s inspired reintroduction and effective use of CIA operative William Donloe (Rolf Saxon) from the franchise’s first release (1996) notwithstanding). In the end, however, this release misses the mark in myriad ways, and that even includes a rather lame conclusion that comes across as stretched out and unsatisfyingly anticlimactic (and that could have been handled better and differently in several alternate scenarios). In my view, this collection of blatant shortcomings is not the way to wrap up a storied franchise like this. I firmly believe that it should have come to an end with the release of “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” (2018), handily the best of the eight features in this series. Indeed, going to the well one (or two!) too many times can tarnish a mythology’s legacy, and “Mission: Impossible” is one such venture. It genuinely deserves to go out with a bang and not a whimper. Unfortunately, though, in this case, the latter is the reality, and that’s truly a shame.",5.0
575265,683861d207c6e8dc98a89438,CinemaSerf,"It might have been a good idea for Tom Cruise to have re-released the first part of this career retrospective a few weeks ago so we could be reminded of just what was in the submarine perched precariously on a subterranean ridge in the Arctic - because I had totally forgotten what happened last time around. Quickly, though, we are reminded that the entity (anyone see the “Forbin Project” from 1970?) is bent on seizing control of the world’s nuclear arsenals and using them to start a process of mutually assured destruction that will eradicate all life on Earth. Luckily “Ethan” (Cruise) has the magic key that might lead to humanity’s salvation, but he also needs the support of his erstwhile bosses, the President of the USA, an aircraft carrier and a nuclear submarine that actually works. Once we have waded through all the recaps the story kicks in with plenty of opportunity for our ingenious hero and his team - largely without Ving Rhames this time - to put together a series of cunning plays and counter-plays to keep themselves ahead of not just the megalomaniacal virus but also the malevolent “Gabriel” (Esai Morales) who reckons he might be able to take control. It’s essentially a vehicle for the star for the supporting efforts from the likes of Hayley Atwell and Simon Pegg offer us little of distinction, but if you’re a fan of action adventure movies then this is the equivalent of a higher-tech “Indiana Jones” movie with car chases; loads of pyrotechnics; great visual effects, an energetic score and it culminates with an enjoyable aerial dogfight that just needed the Red Baron and/or Sir Sean Connery. I am struggling to believe this is really the last of these, but if it is then it’s a fitting denouement for a character that has largely delivered well these last thirty years and that has has come along way from the Peter Graves stuff from the late 1960s.

 ""The Amateur ends up being a mild disappointment, especially given the legitimate expectations raised by the talent involved, both in front of and behind the camera.
 
 Despite a committed performance from Rami Malek, James Hawes' adaptation fails to escape a formulaic, timid, and emotionally shallow narrative - its simplicity and lack of surprise stand as its most significant flaws. There are occasional glimpses of emotional weight, but the script rarely ventures into more complex or thematically challenging territory, resulting in an experience that might entertain in the most basic sense.

1087891,67ff53ea83c6e567c7d928b5,CinemaSerf,"“Heller” (Rami Malek) is the geeky “Jack Ryan” type, stuck in an office five floors below sunlight working on intelligence gathering and decrypting for the CIA. Intrigued by his latest set of dossiers from a deep throat somewhere on the internet, he suspects he has stumbled upon something nefarious. Before he has time to investigate, though, he hears that his wife has been the victim of a terrorist attack in London and so now he’s seeing red. Using the information he has recently obtained as leverage, he gets himself trained and equipped for an operational mission to get some revenge. Thing is, “Heller” isn’t a natural born killer, and despite the best efforts of his handler “Henderson” (Laurence Fishburne) he isn’t considered likely to be much more effective than a wet lettuce when it comes to killing anyone. What we now see is that there are more ways than one to skin a cat and brain can sometimes overcome brawn if applied with plenty of explosives, sticky tape and even the odd rogue missile. That’s perhaps the problem with this film: we’ve seen it all before - and more compellingly, too. Malek does enough but the rest of the cast really underwhelm and the set-piece action scenes come all too few and far between before an ending that really just fizzles out. James Hawes has presented us with a great looking film, packed with gadgets and gizmos, and the story also does make you realise just how big brotherly society has become with cameras apparently everywhere manipulating imagery from your shadow cast on a water-filled dustbin lid - but after a while, that all becomes a little repetitive and the plot settles into an implausible predictability.

1278950,6840199494f9243dc8f2c3f5,CinemaSerf,"I’m guessing that Russell Crowe was busy for this latest exercise in priestly exorcism so an hardly recognisable Al Pacino decided to have a go. He is a Capetian father drafted in to help the reluctant Fr. Joseph (Dan Stevens) with a particularly difficult task. Fr. Theophilus must help rid the poor young Emma (Abigail Cowen) of an unwanted bodily guest. His methods do not impress the rather naive young father, nor the sisters in attendance as she increasingly resorts to involuntary bleeding, foul language, violent outbursts and even the usual hanging upside down from the ceiling lamp trick whilst under relentless assault from the repetitious bible verses being read across what I counted are at least seven of those ritual attempts at expulsion. Sound familiar? Well that’s because it is. Aside from Pacino turning in a slightly different style of performance from his norm, the rest of this hasn’t an original bone in it’s body. Indeed, its only claim to fame appears to be that it is based on the original, almost century old, transcriptions from Fr. Joseph of events that are really supposed to have happened but we’ve seen this all predictably play out so many times before that even the traditional collapsible bed doesn’t turn an head - spiritual or metaphysically. The one element that does provoke a little interest is, perhaps, the clear indication that Catholicism in the 1920s was riddled with incantations, superstitions and a degree of symbolism that probably hadn’t changed since much since there was a Borgia on the throne of St. Peter. This might work on the telly at Halloween of you’re full of Grappa, but as a cinema experience it is disappointing and entirely forgettable, sorry.",5.0

1233413,6801818e83c6e567c7d9a0de,Chris Sawin,"Set in 1932 in Clarksdale, Mississippi, Sinners takes place throughout one night in the middle of October. Sammie Moore (the feature film debut of Miles Caton) is at a crossroads in his life. He is torn between being the son of a preacher and the blues-driven nightlife where he gets to sing, play guitar, and feel alive. Sammie submerges himself in the blues seemingly having little desire to return to his family’s religious roots.
 
 Sammie’s twin cousins Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan) have just returned home after spending seven years in Chicago. With a mobster-like reputation, the twins intend to jumpstart a new jukejoint at an old sawmill previously owned by Klan members. However, they want the grand opening to be that very night, have several arrangements to be made, and have little time to get it all done.
 
 As dusk turns to night and the twins’ new club seems to be off to a successful grand opening, an unspeakable evil lurks on their doorstep waiting to be invited in.
 
 Writer and director Ryan Coogler (Black Panther, Creed) was highly inspired by the works of Robert Rodriguez, so it’s no surprise that Sinners feels like a blacker and more blues-driven version of From Dusk Til Dawn. Sinners is a supernatural action horror film, but it takes its time getting to the horror. The first half of the film is like a well-written gangster film mostly driven by dialogue while introducing a cast of characters that are mostly all worthwhile and entertaining in their ways.
 
 Smoke and Stack have two extremely different personalities with opposing fates in Sinners, which must have been incredible for Michael B. Jordan. Smoke is more serious and lethal like a soldier while Stack is more eccentric and playful in his demeanor. Smoke also wears blue while Stack wears red. The dual performances allow Jordan to dip his toes into being a hero and a villain, two different types of music, and the dark and the light.
 
 This is a vampire film, but it’s also a film about music. Music is the most important aspect of Sinners. The film states that the power of music can heal communities and attract evil. The initial battle between those within the club and the outside dwelling vampires starts as a mostly blacks versus whites standoff but evolves into something much more elaborate.
 
 Like all Ryan Coogler films, Sinners is extremely black-centric but the film also incorporates several different nationalities in a period when whites thought they were the only decent race. The grocery store owners are Chinese, a biracial girl follows Stack from the north back down to the south, and Remmick (Jack O’Connell), the lead vampire, is introduced being chased by Native Americans. The African aspects allow for a deeper appreciation for the film’s stellar score and put much-needed rejuvenation to the cinematic vampire.
 
 Sinners is also a clashing of music genres with the human characters strumming on the blues side of things while the vampires and outsiders lean into Irish folk music and jig dancing. There is this jaw-dropping sequence within the wooden walls of Club Juke when Sammie finally gets to show how talented he is as a musician. It showcases all types of music, classic and contemporary, that have essentially evolved from or been inspired by gutbucket blues (blues or jazz music featuring raw emotions and a gritty, soulful sound).
 
 Vampire folklore is toyed with in a way that is incredibly satisfying in Sinners. The concept of being invited in is something the film approaches extremely well. Music is utilized by both sides to either attempt to keep the living together and safe or to lure them outside to become part of a red-eyed, bloodthirsty pack of undead. There’s the typical lore you expect in a vampire film like trying to use garlic to fend them off and making wooden stakes to drive through their hearts.
 
 But in other vampire films if you kill the head vampire it can either cure those that have been changed or kill all of them. Sinners takes a different route stating that each vampire has to be killed regardless on if their leader is slain. Hoodoo also plays a major part in the film. Wunmi Mosaku (His House, Deadpool & Wolverine) portrays Annie. Annie has an emotional connection to Smoke, but she also practices hoodoo, which allows her to be the voice of reason when bodies start piling up.
 
 Sinners is one of the horniest films to come out of the first part of the year. Films have kind of shied away from showcasing nudity and sex with recent films. Everyone in Sinners is bursting with lust and when they’re not in the middle of copulating or performing cunnilingus or fellatio they’re talking about it in graphic detail.
 
 Sinners is a scary, hilarious, and gloriously horny bloodbath with one hell of a bluesy score. An instant, masterful, and exceptional horror classic that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible.",10.0

 ""Sinners is living proof that major studios can still produce artistic, provocative, and emotionally resonant movies.
 
 With Ryan Coogler's confident and creatively daring direction, an unforgettable, award-worthy score, a strong ensemble cast, and a thematically rich exploration of racial oppression, cultural identity, and spirituality, this is undoubtedly one of the most impactful films of the year so far.
 
 An intense, memorable spectacle with a sharp social commentary - and one that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible.""

1233413,680459cde3fac2f90289c279,Brent Marchant,"It’s always gratifying to see a filmmaker take a big step up in his or her career, and that’s precisely what writer-director Ryan Coogler has done in his latest offering, a project that reflects a significant jump in the depth, artistry and sophistication of his creative output. Coming on the heels of his successes in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (2022), “Creed” (2015) and “Fruitvale Station” (2013), Coogler has hit a home run with this period piece smart horror story about identical twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who return to their Mississippi home in 1932 after years of working for Al Capone in Chicago, where they made huge money that they now plan to use to open their own juke joint in a converted sawmill. It’s an opportunity where they hope to make even bigger bucks while helping to promote their talented cousin, Sammie (Miles Caton), a blues musician who’s a killer guitarist and vocalist. But, as this ambitious trio launches this effort, they’re confronted with a variety of challenges, including ghosts from their past, the perils of deeply ingrained social prejudice, the dual-edged sword posed by creative and financial success, and, most menacingly, mystical forces that may be more than they’re capable of handling. These narrative components combine to tell a captivating tale about a troubled time in the country’s history, one made all the more ominous with the appearance of supernatural powers that simultaneously offer both potential promise and the prospects of tremendous evil taking root. In bringing this picture to life, the filmmaker has served up an entertaining and engaging offering, one replete with fine performances, superb production values, sharp-edged, perfectly timed comic relief, truly inventive, deftly orchestrated cinematography, and suitably restrained (graphic though not gratuitous) imagery. Admittedly, the screenplay could use some work in a few spots (most notably with tighter writing and clearer plot elaboration), but it also manages to successfully fuse the inherent nature of several genres, including drama, dark humor and smart horror, while also presenting a wealth of insights in an array of areas. Through this picture, it’s easy to see how Coogler has appreciably upped his game as a filmmaker, one that bodes well for his future in the field. It indeed represents the revelation of a talent more profound than anyone has previously recognized or properly acknowledged. “Sinners” is a work that deserves to be remembered come awards season later this year. Let’s hope that it is.",8.0
1233413,680acb1763c5f9522989a1fa,r96sk,"<em>'Sinners'</em> is a fair load of fun. It admittedly didn't fully knock my socks off, but there isn't any doubt that it is a very good film. It's stylish with impressive music and visuals, whilst all of the acting talent give good performances. It's paced astutely too.
 
 Michael B. Jordan is as entertaining as he usually tends to be, I do like seeing him act. The dual role is done well here, the 'split screen' is solid but my brain sillily - no matter the movie or standard of how they portray the same actor twice - simply cannot interpret the effect as seamless.
 
 Jack O'Connell stands out behind Jordan, particularly for the moments of sing. Hailee Steinfeld and Wunmi Mosaku are the others that I took notice of too, same can be said for Delroy Lindo, Li Jun Li and Omar Miller; I oddly always think of <em>'American Pie Presents: Band Camp'</em> with the latter (I'm so sorry, Omar).
 
 I must say, the trailers revealed too much. I tend to avoid those so assume I didn't get the full brunt of it anyway, though even so I remember catching a couple of bits that don't occur until the gritty part of the movie. It's no biggie, trailers are designed to get bums on seats after all.",8.0

 The setting, music, costumes, makeup, gore, and effects were exceedingly well done. The film is well-acted (Delroy Lindo was the standout) and it was definitely worth seeing in the theatre. 
 
 My only complaints are that the ending felt rushed, there are a couple of oddly out of place surrealist sequences, and the villain was weak. It's a fairly long film already, but I think it would have been better if we'd gotten to see another 10 minutes of the interaction between the villain and his initial pursuers, and a few flashbacks would have been helpful. 
 
 I also think this story would have worked better as a TV series, but still, a very original and enjoyable film. It reminded me a fair bit of the first season of Interview with a Vampire.",8.0
1233413,6817b48b12fd9fa97e1d0dc9,Xtram555mo,"Sinners started off similar to a gritty drama in the Deep South, every character felt so built and I was fully invested.  Then the vampire elements started twirling in. That first fade into the moon, the guitar riff, unbelievably hard Mr. Coogler. It gave a feeling I haven’t felt since watching dune 2. Oh and the scene where we go through the history and future of music, best scene of the decade maybe? That juke joint was heaven for clarksville that night, a place where people could finally let loose and forget about all their work to enjoy powerful music, rooted in their ancestry. I ascended to heaven, and I’m not coming back down.
 
 
 Under here is a review I wrote in a discord server you don’t need to read it it’s pretty basic:
 
 
 Sinners is the new film from Ryan Coogler, and his first fully original story. This movie just proves how awesome and competent of a director Ryan Coogler is. This movie expertly genre blends drama with horror, which all encompasses the theme of black ownership, music, and religion. 
 
 Sinners is one of the best new movies I’ve seen this decade. The cinematography (which I luckily saw in 70mm IMAX) was so beautiful and had chills every time the frame would expand to show off a landscape, and breathtaking sunsets and sunrises. Sometimes the frame would transition from a haunting 🤫 to a beautiful moonlight which was backed by the 10/10 musical score. I will mention more later.
 
 BTW this movie has one of the BEST SEQUENCES that will make you ASCEND IN YOUR SEAT. Jaw was dropped. It’s not even a horror sequence.
 
 The horror elements are so well used in this movie, it’s like kissing somebody and you get a tingle everywhere when something awesome happens. Everything is so badass and goes hard. The action made me shake for the whole 3rd act, it ruled. The end got very emotional too. So so so freaking perfect. See this in a theater.
 
 Oh yeah the score. THE GUITAR SHREDDING AT THE BEST TIMES OHOOHOHOHOOH

1233413,681f15b1a74b6fc9ebc84997,CinemaSerf,"Michael B. Jordan is “Smoke” and twin brother “Stack” in this classy drama of a pair who’ve lived on the wrong side of the tracks for most of their lives, but have determined to go home and try to go straight. To that end, they buy an old barn and hope to set up their own speakeasy - with only a nominal nod to prohibition - pumping to the rafters with dancing and blues music. On the way, they ally with talented musician “Sammie” (Miles Caton) and, of course, there’s a bit of baggage for the siblings as they return to a town that’s not altogether welcoming. Once home, a mixture of confidence, threats and collective charisma succeeds in assembling a crowd for their opening night. Pretty swiftly, though, that grand celebration attracts the attention of some travellers who are keen to join the party, but perhaps in true Charlie Daniels style, they have an altogether more menacing agenda. This is the cinematic equivalent of an LP, this film. It starts with one side gradually introducing us a rich collection of characters all of whom could quite plausibly have lived in Mississippi at a time when segregation was as rife as illicit booze, and the two more recently hailing from Chicago gives things a certain gangster element too. There is also a very subtly powerful effort from Hailee Steinfield as “Mary” too. The flip side of the record proceeds to develop some elements of peril with the story, and that’s where it rather runs out of steam for me. It tries very hard to create a sense of hot, sweaty and frenzied jeopardy, but maybe because it has already taken quite a long time to get to this stage, that all comes across as a bit rushed and lacking in punch. It looks great, the visual effects are convincing enough and the production design smoulders perfectly. In the end, though, whilst it proves that MBJ is comfortably able to hold a story, Ryan Coogler has overly relied on a marvellously toe-tapping musical score that has been left to do much of the heavy lifting. That latter point is made more essential by a mediocre audio mix that can make the dialogue quite difficult to make out more often than I’d have liked. This seems to be an increasing issue as directors become more ambitious with their visual aspirations leaving the one thing that cannot be readily faked/augmented - the sound - left at the altar. It’s a cinema film, and will look distinctly average on a television so big screen and soundtrack audio is essential to get the best from this silky looking story with an interesting twist at the end, and again at the very end.",7.0

1233413,6839759bc7b98fbab65598e8,MovieFestUK,"Sinners (2025) – A Spiritual, Sonic, Soul-Shaking Masterpiece
 
 There are films that claim to echo with heart, with history, with heritage—and then there is ""Sinners,"" Ryan Coogler’s audacious, transcendent blend of Gothic folklore, musical soulcraft, and cultural reclamation. It doesn’t just echo. It sings. It howls. It bleeds. From its first frame to its devastating final image, Sinners is a full-bodied spiritual experience masquerading as horror—a rare, roaring anomaly that doesn’t fit inside a genre but redefines what cinema can be when it chooses truth over trope.
 
 At the centre of this cinematic exorcism is music—not as adornment, but as DNA. The film’s heartbeat is the blues. And it is through that heartbeat that Coogler tells a tale steeped in generational trauma, Black identity, post-war brotherhood, the spectral weight of history, and the enduring fight for Black ownership in the face of cultural erasure. But unlike anything we've seen before, Sinners fuses those themes with a chilling yet poetic vampire mythos that feels entirely earned, never performative. It is horror, yes—but elevated horror. Arthouse. Operatic. Biblical.
 
 The Blues as Bloodline
 
 Set in the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s, Sinners follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack—both played, exquisitely and with startling distinction, by Michael B. Jordan—who return home to open a juke joint. This place, more than a bar, becomes a church of sorts: a sanctuary of soul, a communal hearthstone where Black folk gather to drink, dance, and reclaim their joy. The walls of the juke joint hum with possibility. With danger. With prophecy. Even if only for one night.
 
 And then there’s the moment. The moment that marks ""Sinners"" not just as a great film, but a holy text of black magic. Sammie, the film’s humble preacher-boy turned guitar savant, takes to the stage. He plays the blues—slow, aching, ancestral. As he sings, the camera glides across the dance floor in a long, liquid motion, capturing the swelling ecstasy of Black joy. And then the music begins to evolve. It morphs, imperceptibly at first, weaving through the history of Black music—African tribal chants, gospel, jazz, funk, soul, R&B, hip-hop—all spiralling into the foundation laid by the blues. It's not a medley; it’s a resurrection. An invocation. This is music as invocation. And in that moment, it summons something darker.
 
 Outside the joint, stands the vampire Remmick, captivated by the sounds, eyes glowing like embers, face lit with a deranged smile. He listens intently, staring into the soul of their cultural history as the place is set spiritually ablaze. Sammie's music called to something ancient. Something seductive. Something that knows the blues because it was born of the same sorrow.
 
 A Clash of Cultures—Scored to Perfection
 
 What Coogler and composer Ludwig Göransson achieve with the film’s score is revolutionary. The music is not just thematic; it is political. It is narrative. When the scenes pulse with Black culture, the music leans blues, jazz, rhythm. But when Remmick and his fellowship—white vampires born of pain and craving—invade, the score rips into metal, into noise. The clash is jarring. Purposeful. It feels like an act of war. The blues is not just an aesthetic—it’s a battlefield. And the music becomes the weapon, the shield, and the lament.
 
 The result is a full-body experience. As Remmick’s power grows, the music becomes louder, more aggressive, less familiar. It’s a stunning metaphor: Black culture, as it always has, being appropriated, corrupted, and consumed until it’s unrecognisable to those who birthed it. And yet, it fights back. Every scene feels like a spiritual wrestling match, waged through melody and rhythm.
 
 Remmick: The Devil At The Door
 
 Jack O’Connell gives a performance so disturbingly charismatic you almost want to follow him into the dark and join his fellowship. Remmick isn’t just a villain—he’s a prophet of perversion.
 
 A being who believes, earnestly, that he is liberating the people he turns. He doesn’t kill for sport; he offers salvation through eternal night. He doesn’t deny his love for Black culture—he craves it. He worships it. He believes the blues is a divine language, one that called him into existence. His monologues are lyrical and damning, his gaze never cruel, always convincing. You don’t root for him. But you understand why someone would.
 
 One scene in particular—outside the joint, where he sings “Picked Poor Robin Clean” in the dark with his newly-turned—should be studied. It is eerily beautiful, the harmony between vampire and victim pitch-perfect, terrifying. When he and his hive recite the Lord’s Prayer in unison with Sammie, the lines between the sacred and the profane dissolve entirely. It’s religious horror at its most potent—unflinching, unforgettable.
 
 Brothers in Arms, Brothers in Grief
 
 Jordan’s dual performance as Smoke and Stack is nothing short of masterful. Stack is lighter, a dreamer. Smoke is war-weathered, clenched, sceptical. But together, they form a complete man—until tragedy forces one to stand alone. There’s a small scene near the end that shattered me more than any of the horror sequences. Smoke, shaking, tries to roll a cigarette for himself, something Stack always did for him. He fails. His hands tremble. A moment so small, yet so laden with grief, PTSD, and love that it lingers long after the credits roll. Coogler knows the power of silence. Of memory. Of unspoken bonds. And I appreciate the care that went into making sure a detail so seemingly small, was given a fitting final detail, that reassured me of the passion that went into every single god damn scene.
 
 The Voice That Summoned the Storm
 
 Miles Caton’s debut as Sammie Moore doesn’t just mark the arrival of a new talent—it announces a generational voice. At just 20, Caton steps into the role of the preacher’s son with a presence that feels both timeless and urgent. His musical roots run deep—raised in a gospel-rich family, he’s been singing since the age of three, and his voice carries that lineage with soulful weight.
 
 Caton not only sings in Sinners but co-wrote the haunting original track “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” with Alice Smith and composer Ludwig Göransson. Learning blues guitar in just two months for the role, his performance in the juke joint sequence is a revelation—channeling pain, power, and prophecy in equal measure. It’s no wonder director Ryan Coogler described him as “a once-in-a-lifetime voice.” Caton’s portrayal of Sammie is the film’s heartbeat—a blend of innocence and depth that lingers long after the credits roll.
 
 Framing the Fire
 
 Autumn Durald Arkapaw’s cinematography in Sinners is nothing short of masterful. Making history as the first female cinematographer to shoot on large-format IMAX film, she crafts a visual narrative that is both expansive and intimate. Utilizing a blend of IMAX and Ultra Panavision 70 formats, the film’s shifting aspect ratios serve the story’s emotional beats—widening to capture the vastness of the Mississippi Delta, then narrowing to draw us into the characters’ inner worlds.
 
 Night scenes glow with a haunting luminescence, firelight dances with purpose, and each frame feels meticulously composed yet organically alive. Arkapaw’s lens doesn’t just show us the world of Sinners—it immerses us in its soul, making the supernatural elements feel grounded and the historical context visceral. Her work elevates the film, turning each scene into a painting that breathes.
 
 Anchors in the Storm
 
 Delroy Lindo's performance is like jazz—unpredictable, soulful, and necessary. He doesn't undercut the film's tension, but rather gives it breath. In a narrative that leans heavy on atmosphere and myth, he injects a kind of familial levity that feels earned and lived-in. His presence is grounding, a reminder of what’s at stake when the horror threatens to strip the story of its humanity. And then there’s Hailee Steinfeld, as Mary, bringing a layered grace to the screen—mischievous, magnetic, and caught between identities. Raised with Smoke and Stack, her loyalty runs deep, but her character exists in a space that blurs lines—between belonging and otherness, tradition and disruption. There's a quiet poetry to how her arc unfolds, and you’re left wondering whether she’s a reflection of what it means to straddle cultures, or a symbol of something even more elusive. Either way, she leaves a mark—fierce and unforgettable. And then there's Wunmi Mosaku’s portrayal of Annie, which anchors the film with a quiet yet potent strength. She is a bridge to ancestral wisdom, embodying the resilience and spiritual power of the Black community. Her presence is not loud, but her influence is undeniable—rooted in healing and protection, offering a steady counterpoint to the chaos around her. Annie doesn’t just fight evil with wisdom—she fights to preserve the very soul of her people.
 
 This soul isn't for sale
 
 And in a film layered with metaphor and meaning, black ownership doesn’t just echo—it resounds. It's not a theme that visits—it’s the architecture. And Sammie becomes the embodiment of that principle. His music, his soul, his presence—they’re not just narrative devices, they’re battlegrounds. There’s a moment—powerful, worded like an offer but weighted like a threat—where what’s being asked isn’t blood or vengeance, but ownership of that brilliance. Remmick offers everybody else their lives if they let him take Sammie, but Slim responds ""he's ours."" It’s not a loud moment. But it cuts deep. And it’s in the refusal—in the stillness of collective resistance—that the film finds one of its most potent truths. That cultural power isn’t just about legacy—it’s about protection, unity, and the refusal to be harvested.
 
 Beyond the Oscars
 
 There are films designed to win Oscars. And then there are films like Sinners—films that make awards feel meaningless. Because what do statues mean when you’ve built a monument? Sinners is that monument. To music. To Blackness. To art. To survival. To Cinema. It doesn’t just earn your praise. It earns your soul.
 
 In a world where genre cinema often feels disposable, Sinners is an inheritance. A film made by people who love the culture deeply enough to protect it, critique it, and immortalise it. It is horror not just of the supernatural, but of history, of identity, of being seen and erased all at once.
 
 And yet, it is joyous. It is poetic. It is epic. It is... unforgettable.",

 Thankfully I didn't see any film trailers but I did glance over a few magazine covers to see it was a movie about twins and vampires.
 
 What I didn't know was that it was also a period piece so that was a surprise.
 
 How the vampires appeared was also a surprise. I  thought one of the twins was already a vampire and had somehow hidden it from his brother.
 
 I liked the Stephen King aspect of ordinary day turning to sh!t and good luck surviving.
 
 What was missed in all the reviews I saw here: spiritual and cultural aspects that may have gone over folks' heads.
 
 Did anyone understand Mary's real link to the Black community? What does her survival as a vampire say about that precarious aspect of her previous life versus her life after life?
 
 Did anyone see an almost mockery of religion in the vampires' siren call and the ""triumph"" of the Black church in Sammie's survival?
 
 How does this flow with narratives of good versus evil?
 
 Freedom is an overarching theme. 
 
 Free to go north and work for gangsters. Free to own property/open a juke joint. Free to enjoy an evening of dance and drink. Free to LIVE.
 
 Money is supposed to bring freedom but money that spends only in the Delta won't free anyone. 
 
 Music offers the unification that could quell separatism but isn't always able to deliver the promise.
 
 Musicians forced to play for racists by the police. Vampires singing to lure Sammie out. The singing at church. The singing in the juke joint. Sammie surviving to sing and play for several more decades.
 
 Any freedom in the world of Sinners is temporary at best.

 ""I Know What You Did Last Summer is a glossy, shallow reboot that mistakes recognition for resonance, failing to revitalize the franchise in any meaningful way.
 
 Despite a few solid performances and flashes of potential, the film never finds its footing as horror, legacy sequel, or even as a character-driven drama. It's not thrilling, it's not moving, and it's certainly not memorable.
 
 The only thing I know for sure is that I'll never revisit this summer.""

 The film starts out with a fairly strong intro, but the central character here doesn't have any impact on the rest of the film, so it feels wasted. 
 
 It switches plots halfway through after a strong start, inexplicably. 
 
 I assume the new evolved infected were meant to be scary. I found them to be unintentionally hilarious in several scenes, and if you watch this film you'll understand why.
 
 The later portions of the film are just as nonsensical, but in short, it gets more and more absurd as it progresses.
 
 Wait to see it on streaming.",4.0
1100988,6857327f8b1a50481efc766a,TwdPepper,"**A beautiful film with a handful of odd choices.**
 
 I was hesitant going into this film. On one hand, it was a mainstream zombie film with a big budget and a competent crew. But on the other hand, it was in a franchise I have never loved, and it was the start of a new trilogy. So, while I was confident that it would be a solid movie, I did not know if it would work for me personally or if it would feel like it could stand on its own. I walked out of the theater satisfied with the film. And in the day since, I have grown even more positive on it and am giving it a **9 out of 10**. I think the part that will surprise people the most is the emotional weight that the film carries. And it all comes from the great set of characters and their relationships. There is a lot of heart and even some great humor to get you invested. This elevates the film above being just another fun zombie movie. But let's talk about the zombies/infected. There are a couple new ideas introduced with them in this that I really dig. They are more monstrous than ever, but they are also showing more humanity than ever. The action and kills are a lot of fun. Everything is as fast and terrifying as usual with this franchise. So, the action is mostly fantastic. I say 'mostly' because there are a couple of editing choices that I think distract from the action more than they enhance it. I can say the same for a handful of other points in the film. They chose to insert flashes of other footage at times. One of the times I loved it. One of the times it was weird and actually felt like a trailer for the movie. And another time, it was just very confusing. (I still don't know the meaning of it) Those are a couple of the times where the style didn't fully work. But for 95% of the film, it does! This film has a look that is so unique. **It feels both calm and like a nightmare at the same time!** I don't know how they did it. If you have seen the awesome trailer, you get a feel for the style of the film. It does not disappoint. Then, there is a scene at the end that sets up the future of the trilogy. This scene has a style and a tone that is like nothing else in the movie. Truly a WTF moment for the audience. It was bold, and it did not work for me. But since it was just a tease to the future films and not integral to this one, I am willing to forgive it. Because before that, we got an actual ending to the film that was emotionally satisfying. This film has no problem standing on its own. Sure, you are left with more to explore, and certain character arcs are left unfinished. But go in knowing it is a trilogy (and that the next one is coming as soon as this January), and these things hopefully won't bother you. - All in all, **I'm a happy zombie fan! :D**",9.0
1100988,685985bf6b3b3ac6a0b34036,Chin02,"What I will say about this movie is it's not all bad. This first half was really good, with an opening that was reminiscent of 28 Weeks Later. Afterwards though, it cuts to completely different characters for basically the rest of the film. Which would be fine and all, just showing a snippet of how the infection was 28 years before the start of the movie, but it does a weird call back in the ending scene that feels extremely out of place compared to the rest of the film. Aside from that, the first half is really good and the tension of survival of a father and son feels heavy and suspenseful, especially with the addition of a new type of infected: the alpha. This new infected is basically a 'roided up super infected that is both smarter and stronger than normal ones. It's only after making it back to the safe village does the movie noticeably change mood to a more coming of age feeling movie, oddly reminding me a bit of Stand By Me.
 
 It's at this point, my enjoyment of this movie kinda began to fall. This latter half just ends up with the boy and his mom going out to find a doctor. The whole trip, it kinda feels like things just happen. And sure, the second half is about accepting death, but it feels so paved over when the boy has a more violent reaction to his dad cheating than the guy who actually kills. It feels so jarring when that scene happens cause it doesn't really fit how the character acted beforehand. 
 
 After all is said and done, boy stays outside of the safe village and wanders where it ends in a bizarre scene of him running into a pack of survivors which one turns out to be the kid from the opening scene. It's so weird cause it a group of 5 who at first I mistook as a gang of grannies doing par-core and brutalizing some runner infected all while some trash metal was playing in the background. I did get a laugh at the fact that I wasn't the only one in the theater wondering what the hell was going on when that scene started.
 
 TLDR: Movie is good and really suspenseful up until they return to base in witch it turns more into a bad attempt of a coming of age story that finishes off with a power rangers type end scene. This whole movie reminds me of what happened with Longlegs. Advertising made the movie seem like a much different movie vs the actual viewing experience. Don't know how the next to films are gonna be like (if they even release), but seeing how much this first film feels like a filler movie doesn't give me much hope that they'll be good....",5.0

 ""28 Years Later is an imperfect but undeniably bold movie - a worthy addition to the saga.
 
 It's more technically polished, features excellent performances, and even if some of its narrative risks don't pay off, the thematic ambition is admirable, despite struggling to bring all of its elements into a cohesive whole. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland are commenting on the state of the modern world - from national identity crises to the ethics of human survival - delivering moments of high intensity, morally relevant questions, and striking visual filmmaking.
 
 Though not entirely satisfying, the film leaves us with a firm curiosity about the direct sequel arriving in just a few months.""

Protected by the tides, the small island of Lindisfarne is one such bastion and that’s where “Spike” (Alfie Williams) lives with his dad (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his poorly mum (Jodie Comer). It’s a big day in the place when “Spike” is taken to the mainland by his father to make his first kill. That’s not least because he is barely twelve years old and because he has never seen anything of town nor land as far as the eye can see before. He’s also never seen any of the infected before, either. With this trip being fairly fraught and eventful and with one of his family friends at home telling him of a doctor “Kelson” (Ralph Fiennes) who might be able to help his increasingly disturbed mother, the newly emboldened “Spike” comes up with a daring plan to see if he can help make her better. It’s all pretty standard zombie fayre this film but though there is quite a decent effort from the confident young Williams and Comer does lethally equipped confused well too, the rest of it just lacks much for originality. There’s plenty of action, but there was that in “Shaun of the Dead” (2004) too - and at least that was funny. This is just all a bit intense, with the psycho-babble “up and down again” commentary and some inconsistently incorporated archive from old Robin Hood or Olivier films that seem to suggest something of the recurring nature of history, but also of this plot. Sure, it’s only part one of a trilogy and the iodine-bedecked Fiennes does introduce a little quirky intrigue for what might come next, but I was really quite disappointed with this over-hyped and all too often quite episodic horror, sorry.",6.0

 The movie is set 28 years after the infection in a, this time completely, quarantined UK and follow a family who lives in a secured village. The dad has a scouting job so the main plot of the movie follows what happens after the 12 years-old son is exposed to the outside of the village and the many new evolved types of zombies and people that now plague the country.
 
 The movie has good technical quality and the initial sequence with the dad and the child venturing in the open country has the same energy as the first movies, with frenzied zombie pursuits and the feeling you ""can't catch a break"".
 
 However, the director tried too hard to make an artsy movie, with ""The Shining""-like visions, excessive soap-opera drama, and even a ridiculous sequence with people jumping around ""fighting kung fu"" which reminded me of Kung Fu Hustle.
 
 Still a good movie worth watching and with a better editing it could have been the great movie we all expected, but the final format is a bit of a disappointment for the fans that waited for so long.",7.0
1100988,68675e788b020a2d9167728c,MovieGuys,"""28 Years Later"" is a very different film to its predecessors. 
 
 This is humanist tale of what it means to inherit a world that's changed but at its core, remains unchanged. Remember, we all live and we all must die. 
 
 In this sense, the tale of zombies, takes a back seat, as the protagonists have to face the reality of survival but just as importantly, the need to remain human. To live, love and accept loss. 
 
 Whilst the first half of this film feels somewhat static (setting the scene but doing little more), the latter half is inexplicably moving, for a film cast in this genre. 
 
 The chemistry and interplay between Jodie Comer, Alfie Williams and Ralph Fiennes characters, is all too familiar and painfully human, in spite of the post apocalyptic setting. Most especially for those of us, who have experienced the loss, of a parent. 
 
 What I could not grasp and I feel robbed this film of a measure of its impact, was the weird parkour zombie scene, with what looked liked fashion extra's from a Benetton ad, at the films end. Why?
 
 In summary, whilst somewhat uneven, the latter half of this film is excellent, ""almost"" to the closing credits. Most definitively worth a look.",8.0
1100988,68682ad82150c1dcde6e7654,r96sk,"<em>'28 Years Later'</em> delivers a very good flick, I wouldn't rank it too far behind the (albeit superior) original in actuality. I admittedly did think it was going to be more in-your-face unsettling based on a trailer I saw, what with that terrifying (but great!) usage of Rudyard Kipling's ""Boots"".
 
 All the same, it is still unnerving in a good amount of patches; it's, for me, definitely the closest that these films have come to being scary. These movies always nail their casting, whilst this is compartively the weakest cast they still impress. Ralph Fiennes steals the show, mind.
 
 Fiennes is quality, Aaron Taylor-Johnson does bring a strong performance too. Jodie Comer is convincing, while youngster Alfie Williams gives more than what's necessary. Edvin Ryding's part is iffy at first, but by the end I did enjoy him. No complaints with any of 'em.
 
 The final scene is absolutely wild, kinda can't believe they went *there*. I did note the similarities to the fixer instantly but thought I was connecting unconnectable dots, but boy was I spot on. I'm fascinated to see where they go with it; good casting, to be fair.
 
 Not too long to wait for the January 2026 sequel, it'll be worth a watch no matter what given the above. As for this 2025 release, it sure does look the part visually and it happily gives an entertaining story to boot.",8.0

The soundtrack is also nowhere near as catchy, and even though some of the lyrics are quite entertaining, the film lacks a killer song for either leading character. Sure, we've the power ballad ""Beyond"" and ""Maui"" gets the quirky ""Can I Get a Chee Chee"", but they lack the charming silliness of Lin Manuel Miranda's efforts from eight years ago.

1197306,67e6fc6cfa4b524e047680c5,r96sk,"<em>'A Working Man'</em> is imperfectly very good. I do have a couple of issues with it, but all in all I have to say that I did enjoy this to a fairly strong degree. Jason Statham seldom disappoints in an action thriller, I'm a fan of his so was always likely to get the required fun out of this.
 
 Statham is great, naturally without him the movie would be vastly less entertaining. Away from the former British diver (still can't quite believe that's the same guy!), there are too many characters - which is one of the issues I have. There didn't need to be so many peeps in this.
 
 Even so, those onscreen are all decent enough and none register as overt negatives in my mind. David Harbour does well in a small role, he usually speaks the same way in roles but this feels minorly different. Michael Peña and Arianna Rivas are solid, as is Jason Flemyng.
 
 The latter's character should've be the only bad guy in this, or at least one of a few. He gives enough that we didn't need anyone else in my opinion, especially as 'higher-ups' Andrej Kaminsky and Maximilian Osinski give weaker performances. Chidi Ajufo is the best of the rest.
 
 My other issue lies with the run time. I guess with so many characters it did need to be almost two hours in length, however you could've told this story within 90 minutes without a doubt. But again, as noticeable as that and the other issue is, it at least doesn't hinder much for me.",8.0

 Everything is an exaggeration. From the notion of the working class guy, a rough diamond, a patriot,  with a heart of gold. The migrant family with the dutiful, over achiever on steroids daughter, the true inheritors of the American dream. Even, the minimum wage construction workers, who are told to make sure they ""keep their fingers"" (you can see occupational health and safety is a big thing) are so happy they look like they belong in the original production of ""Snow White"" (the real one, not the hideous remake). As for the Russians, well surprise, surprise, they are brutal, cruel and stupid. No one saw that coming, right?
 
 I won't mix words, this is cliched, biased, condescending, pro Western military, jingoistic, crap. Interesting too, how venture capitalists ""State Street"" make a brief appearance, in the opening credits. If they thought this would lift their profile, well all I can say is it didn't ""do it, for me"". Sorry guys. 
 
 Is there an upside? In short no. Even the action has a ham fisted, ""seen it all before"", air of stale, stagnation, about it.

1197306,67ef8874ede8d82f3bad0b34,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"On paper, director David Ayer‘s revenge action thriller “A Working Man” should be a slam dunk for Jason Statham. Based on Chuck Dixon’s novel “Levon’s Trade,” it has all the familiar elements that not only cater to the actor’s strengths, but also to the desires of his most die hard fans. Unfortunately, very little about the film works, and it comes across as dull, predictable, and unmemorable.
 
 Levon (Statham) is a former black ops solider turned construction worker who is forced to return to his lethal past when his boss’s daughter (Arianna Rivas) is abducted by human traffickers. What starts as a rescue mission soon unravels a deeper web of corruption, pushing Levon to do what he does best: take down bad guys with ruthless efficiency.
 
 The premise is well-worn but serviceable, but never quite rises above its own mediocrity. The stunt work is strong and the fights are bloody, but the action sequences mostly lack the punch and creativity needed to garner any feelings of excitement. The action is middling, which makes the uninspired story stand out in the worst way.
 
 Even worse, the film lacks personality. It’s competently made but painfully generic, with a by-the-numbers plot that fails to generate any real emotional stakes. The script (co-written by Ayer and Sylvester Stallone) doesn’t do enough to elevate the material beyond standard action fare.
 
 Despite being well cast, the film wastes a terrific supporting turn from David Harbour, and it feels like the reliable tough guy Statham is running on autopilot. Nobody enjoys watching a movie where the lead actor is delivering a performance that feels more like a contractual obligation than a passion project.
 
 Working in harmony with Ayer’s directorial style, Shawn White’s cinematography proves to be the brightest spot. This is a polished, good looking action thriller, at least visually speaking.
 
 If I had to sum up “A Working Man” in one word, it would be “serviceable.” This is a film that will be buried under Statham’s long list of similar (and much better) movies.

Director and co-writer Kurtis David Harder‘s film embraces the online influencer culture with a project that has shades of “Single White Female” and “Sissy,” and it’s filled with enough psychological suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.
 
 Madison (Emily Tennant) is a popular social media influencer who planned a lavish trip to Thailand with her boyfriend Ryan (Rory J Saper), who bailed at the last minute. Determined to save her vacation, she heads to the country alone and films videos for her loyal followers, making it seem like she’s have a much better time than she actually is. One night at the hotel bar, she meets CW (Cassandra Naud), a fearless and knowledgeable traveler who offers to take Madison under her wing and show her the most Instagram-worthy locations around. They develop a quick friendship, bonding over food, drinks, and the love of adventure. Things seem to be looking up for Madison until CW takes her for a surprise overnight camping visit to a deserted island that’s completely off the grid.
 
 Instead of the typical story of a man preying on a woman traveling alone, in this scenario it’s a female (which somehow makes her feel more trustworthy). You aren’t concerned for Madison’s safety at first, because CW seems like a really cool, friendly person. Once you begin to feel uneasy about her intentions, it’s already too late. The script, which Harder co-wrote with Tesh Guttikonda, is clever but never annoying, and the narrative goes to as many unexpected places as it does familiar. Although the premise can sometimes feel like something you’ve seen before, the story has enough natural and unforced surprises to keep you guessing and engaged.
 
 A major part of the reason the film works so well is that the story seems plausible and realistic, and the performances from the cast are terrific. Naud is unsettling as a genuine psychopath who is a master of manipulation, and Tennant and Sara Canning as social media superstars are extremely believable in their roles. Harder is a skilled director who handles the material well, and he understands the cinematic language of the thriller.
 
 Some of the best parts of “Influencer” are also the most unexpected, so I have actively avoided revealing too many spoilers in this review. The film offers a chilling look at our natural insecurities, arrogance, and conceit when it comes to our online presence, but it also is a really fun horror-thriller that’s exceptionally satisfying.",6.0

 Featuring more polished action set pieces, genuinely funny moments, and enough emotional depth to engage the audience, Gavin O'Connor delivers a story that is both highly entertaining and thrilling, falling short of greatness only due to an overabundance of secondary threads and occasional narrative loss of focus.
 
 Still, the impeccable chemistry of its lead duo and the honest - if imperfect - attempt to tackle sensitive topics with respect guarantee a personal recommendation for anyone looking for a pleasant night out at the movies.""

870028,6817123536e319d00d08a0c8,CinemaSerf,"To be honest, I’d completely forgotten about the original “Accountant” (2016) so wasn’t expecting much from this. Thing is, it’s quite good fun as the meticulous bean-counter with some deep, dark, secrets (Ben Affleck) has to team up with his estranged brother “Braxton” (Jon Bernthal) and an even less willing government agent “Medina” (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to try to discover just why her boss (J.K. Simmons) was gunned down after a clandestine meeting in a dodgy nightclub. It seems that the siblings have more in common that we (or she) might have expected, and when their techniques manage to successfully marry one’s access to cutting edge technology with the other’s propensity to punch first and sweep up after, she finds herself terribly conflicted. It all seems to come down to some heinous people-trafficking thugs who will stop at nothing to protect their lucrative business and to thwart their investigations, and so some high-stakes assassins are soon on the trail of our intrepid trio. Nope, there’s nothing especially original here. It’s a sort of “John Wick” meets the “A-Team” sort of exercise that allows Affleck to sport a rather odd-sounding accent and Bernthal to wander around in his Calvins exuding a sort of comedy menace that his tattoos do nothing to increase. It’s the latter man who entertainingly does most of the heavy lifting here as the gung-ho enforcer and there’s just an hint of social comment in the form of those scouring the internet to piece together jigsaw puzzles from cameras and fragments of information, but whom society might not have expected to possess such formidably cerebral skills. The denouement does rather run to type, but there’s an abundance of chemistry between the two men that stays the right side of familial sentiment whilst Robinson tries to make sense of it all without an enormous amount of meat on the bones of her role. It’s an enjoyable action adventure that won’t trouble any awards juries, ever, but effortlessly passes a couple of hours and does make you consider just how much of our lives these days is being monitored, recorded and manipulated without us being even vaguely aware.",7.0
870028,681b312d26e720062d5af3e0,MovieGuys,"""Accountant 2"" is an inadequate sequel to a vastly superior, original action thriller. 
 
 Regrettably, unlike the original film this is a production that doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it an action film or perhaps a comedy?
 
 The result is confused and frankly, irritating. The poorly devised comedic elements get in the way of what should be a sophisticated, serious, action film. Its akin to a moron with a air horn and bad jokes, turning up at a Shakespeare festival. 
 
 Suffice to say, you can probably skip the first twenty or so minutes of this film and it wont make an iotas  difference, to the story. Unless, of course, you enjoy watching an accountant with an autism spectrum disorder, try to date the cast, of desperate house wives. Who in their right mind, thought that contrivance, was even remotely humorous. 
 
 What comes after is alright from an  exposition driven perspective but again, it undermines the basis of the core story. A lone wolf character, trapped in his own world, who is interesting and engaging, in large part, for that reason. What the script clumsily does instead is try a ""buddy buddy"" team up. The results not great and sadly the dismal, dysfunctional humour, that essentially mocks the main characters autism, continues in unsophisticated, cringe worthy style. 
 
 In summary, a mediocre, at times stupid, sequel, to a vastly superior, original film. I'm almost inclined to say don't watch this, if you enjoyed the first film. It'll probably just piss you off, as it did me.",5.0

870028,68505e6342711a3891f78fc6,YouShouldKnow,"The movie about an actual accountant was followed up by one about a straight up killer going through a mid-life crisis and doing no accounting whatsoever - unless you consider counting kills. The first half of the movie requires a re-watch to understand what one just watches because the scenes just seem completely disconnected to the entire movie. Some of them might actually have nothing to do with the story are just filler or serve as a ""show of power"" with no effect on the story.
 
 Despite the entire story being revealed, the whole time one would be posing the question: what does this have to do with an accountant? Even the final scenes just raises the question: how in the world would he know? He just went on a rampage for some superhuman  hunch? The previous movie made certain things plausible, but this one just is a disconnected mess that forgets to explain things and does a bunch hand-waving ""you know he's superhuman, so he can do this"".
 
 All in all, if you think you're getting another ""accountant"" follow-up, you'll be disappointed. This is a Rambo meets X-Men meets The Punisher meets midlife crisis movie using ""The Account"" characters. If that's your feel, you'll enjoy it.",4.0

 ""Clown in a Cornfield is a pleasant surprise in the 2025 horror landscape. It starts off rather generically - a conservative town, a group of rebellious teens, a masked killer - but quickly finds its own identity through well-crafted social commentary and a strong execution of slasher tropes.
 
 With solid performances, confident direction from Eli Craig, and a healthy dose of dark humor, the movie wins over its target audience through gory entertainment and thematic relevance, even if not all of its ideas are fully explored and some narrative decisions feel more convenient than organic.
 
 It's a grim but clever portrait of a society in denial, where the past refuses to die… even when it's literally buried in a cornfield.""
 
 Rating: B",7.0
713364,681bdbecfabf6d4bec01e63e,Chris Sawin,"Based on the 2020 novel of the same name by Adam Cesare, Clown in a Cornfield follows 17-year-old Quinn Maybrook (Katie Douglas) and her father (Aaron Abrams) moving to Kettle Springs, Missouri. After the passing of Quinn’s mother the previous summer, Kettle Springs had an opening for a family doctor which caused the surviving Maybrooks to move from the big city to a small rural town.
 
 The local corn syrup factory burned down recently and its mascot, a clown named Frendo, has become a celebratory icon for Kettle Springs. With a town holiday known as Founders Day fast approaching, the townsfolk are noticeably on edge with new people moving in and the younger generation making dreaded internet videos.
 
 As Quinn tries to make friends in a town she never wanted to move to, an actual killing spree by someone wearing a clown costume drenches Kettle Springs in a sea of blood.
 
 The clown sequences in Clown in a Cornfield are the film's highlights. Interestingly, a jack-in-the-box toy pops up whenever someone is about to die prompting you to think of a connection or deeper meaning to Frendo that never actually occurs. But some of the kills are incredibly solid like the gnarly chainsaw kill in the middle of the cornfield, the barbell kill you see glimpses of in the trailer, and a brutal pitchfork sequence that results in two deaths.
 
 Everything in between teenagers getting slaughtered is rather clunky. Clown in a Cornfield doubles down on this The Breakfast Club meets Dead & Buried ambiance, but never quite gets there. Kettle Springs sees MadTV’s Will Sasso as the town sheriff and it’s bizarre. He plays the role completely straight, but Sheriff Dunne is rather forgettable otherwise.
 
 The cast is mostly fine when it comes to passable performances. Katie Douglas slides into her role as Quinn Maybrook more comfortably as the film progresses and as the events in the film become more hectic. Early on in the film, it’s as if Douglas has this permanent pouty face and duck lips expression that is entirely obnoxious.
 
 Kevin Durand is the unexpected delight of the cast though. Durand has always been a supporting actor that is a sleeper hit in whatever he pops up in with Abigail and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes being prime examples. As Arthur Hill, Durand initially comes off as a stereotypical father who is part of a lucrative family that founded the town. But he evolves into something else entirely that is wholly crucial to the circus-themed massacre.
 
 The slasher film introduces a blood feud between the older and younger generations. High school students are sneered at, looked down on, and judged for things they didn’t ever do or think about doing. The sheriff seems to make his laws and teachers dish out detention for no reason.
 
 There’s a reveal regarding Frendo that transpires roughly halfway through the film that feels like it happens entirely too soon. Co-writer and director Eli Craig (Tucker and Dale vs Evil) and co-writer Carter Blanchard (uncredited screenwriter on Independence Day: Resurgence) could have teased this reveal for far longer. It would have been much more satisfying.
 
 The friends that Quinn makes in Kettle Springs are the more popular high school kids but are also the most troublesome. They have a YouTube channel with over 600K subscribers and their content is short horror films featuring one of them dressed as Frendo killing people. It results in this troublesome dynamic where when a clown does start killing people nobody believes them. They don’t even believe it themselves at first even when they start being targeted.
 
 There isn’t a ton of humor in Clown in a Cornfield, but at least two instances come to mind that are fairly amusing. The sequence where Quinn and Janet (Cassandra Potenza) don’t know how to operate a rotary phone is classic and it’s a shame that it’s given away in the trailer. Older technology in general like driving a car with a manual transmission is a concept Clown in a Cornfield explores quite a bit.
 
 There’s also a moment when two girls are tossing around a severed head like a hot potato because they think it’s fake. They have this bitchy back-and-forth that is very LSP from Adventure Time interacting with a minor inconvenience kind of commentary and it’s fantastic.
 
 Clown in a Cornfield displays moments of coulrophobic greatness. Frendo is a brutal psychopath whose weird devotion to the clown art form (like his big shoes that squeak when he walks during the most tense moments of stalking his prey) attempts to make the audience laugh through the moments of terror.
 
 The film is overflowing with palpable teenage energy though. Clown in a Cornfield is based on a young adult novel, so it’s expected but the constant barrage of “adults just don’t understand us” and the nonstop desire to drink themselves stupid at every opportunity becomes predictable and tiresome.
 
 The kills are entertaining, but the young versus old debacle and less than surprising Frendo “twist” makes Clown in a Cornfield decent, but not memorable.",6.0
713364,6849328b8c72ca56d31eb416,CinemaSerf,"Ok, so there’s not much original about this cornfield chopper, but I think that’s the point. It sets itself up right from the start as more of a parody of so many other films of the genre, and I really quite enjoyed it. Of course we have to start with the daughter/father relationship that’s reeling from a tragedy, then they move to an old rickety house that really does need it’s chimney seeing to before she sets of to school dressed for a “Rocky Horror” party. “Quinn” (Katie Douglas) quickly falls in the with the town’s rowdy crowd, led by wealthy eye-candy “Cole” (Carson MacCormac) which just earns her the annoyance of her dad (Aaron Abrams) and just about all of the local bigwigs. This lot like to have a few drinks then make spoof horror films in which they get brutally slain by a clown from the cornfield then post them on the internet. It’s when once such frolic turns out to be just a bit more serious that things get altogether more menacing for our troop of teenagers. What now ensues, well you’ve seen it all before lots of times but this time it’s tongue is in it’s cheek, there’s a (pretty obvious) twist in the romantic tale and the whole enterprise is reminiscent of “Scooby Do” does the “Klu Klux Clown”. There’s plenty of screaming histrionics, chainsaws, crawling through sewers and you could bathe like Cleopatra in the amount of ketchup, or corn syrup, that’s splashed about as it races along. If you’re looking for BAFTA acting skills, then perhaps not, but if you can watch this in the context that it is an entertaining satire of those gone before it, then I think it’s quite good fun and who knows, there might even be a sequel.",7.0

936108,6873c844dd25edf6337058f4,BryanGreyson,"The art style(s) were surprisingly good, better than I assumed from the trailers. The jokes, spoken and visual, also worked out really well in my opinion.
 
 I don't like the role dynamic of Gargamel and Razamel. They should've stuck with Gargamel alone and have him stick to his usual self.
 
 Too many characters ""try to be cool"". It's fine to have a ""cool"" character, but all of them trying to be? Dangerously close to Marvel's ""the villains are just laughing stocks"" situation.
 
 The story was barely coherent. It felt more like a ""Alice in Wonderland"" trip where individual, short ideas were lived out.
 
 Also, unnecessary deus-ex-machina moments that could've been written to be emotional and nice, but instead are resolved ""magically"" like that.
 
 The live-action scenes were completely unnecessary. Even more than in the two Neil Patrick Harris Smurfs movies. Like...completely unnecessary!
 And also kinda strange, because there were actual live-action humans, and then there's animated humans like Gargamel and Razamel, contrary to the other Smurf movies where Gargamel was also live-action.
 
 So, yeah. The movie would be better without those.
 
 So, overall, a bit disappointing. It could've been a really nice movie. The jokes are good, visual style and gags work REALLY well, but the main story was a mess to me.
 
 I guess it's fine if you care more about the characters than the story.

822119,67af96056d1a7b60523b7972,r96sk,"<em>'Captain America: Brave New World'</em> came close to pleasing me, but in the end I think it is not consistently enjoyable enough to be classed as something I'd want to watch again and/or recommend. There is quite a bit about it that I did like, but the down moments hurt the ups.
 
 The cast and their characters are positives. I'm a big fan of Anthony Mackie's as he has done many roles in films that I've highly, highly enjoyed; interestingly, he has appeared in three of the fourteen films I've given a total 10/10 to. Here, he is very good in the titular part.
 
 I'm not someone overly attached to Marvel and therefore Chris Evans' Captain America, so this new era doesn't hinder my interest in the lead character. I'm admittedly not wholly convinced Mackie is undoubtedly a perfect fit for the role, though his performance itself is perfectly watchable and fun enough.
 
 Carl Lumbly's performance as Isaiah is great in this, he genuinely made me care quite a bit about Bradley; especially in the more emotive scenes. Danny Ramirez, Harrison Ford, Giancarlo Esposito (a little typecast still, sadly) and Tim Blake Nelson (albeit the weakest) are also pluses that I have for this movie.
 
 My main issues lie with the plot and how it is told. There were too many moments where I could feel myself losing interest in events onscreen, most notably across the first half. The second half is better paced, if still not making for superb viewing. I was firmly awaiting the credits, which is never a good sign.
 
 When I was locked on to the story, I did dig it. I particularly found the interactions/dynamics between characters to be solid, for example Cap with Carl, Joaquin and Seth. I just think what lets this down, unfortunately to a somewhat damaging degree, is that the plot just isn't quite good enough. A shorter run time (even though it isn't that long) may have helped, but I'm not sure.
 
 I just realised that this is the first MCU film that I've scored below 7/10. That feels harsh, it isn't as bad as that sounds at all, but thinking about this and the other flicks from the franchise that I've rated similarly it is actually merited. <em>'The Incredible Hulk'</em> and <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em> were my bottom two, both are better films.",6.0
822119,67b06a59201d9bf64e6c457e,CinemaSerf,"“Brave New World” but same old yarn, sadly. Morgan Freeman clearly didn’t fancy this one so Marvel have resurrected another ex-president in Harrison Ford to put together a treaty that will deliver the old save the globe type of thing. It’s all about this giant hand-shaped structure that has emerged from the ocean and that contains “adamantium” - and that’s even more indestructible than “Vibranium” (how can something be more indestructible?). Anyway, before this accord can get signed off by a curious quadrumvirate of the USA, India, France and China a shipment of this new material gets pinched and it’s down to “Capt. America” (Anthony Mackie) and his new sidekick “Torres/Falcon” (Danny Ramirez) to retrieve it. Loads of end-to-end fisticuffs later and the goods are secure which earns our dynamic duo and their inspirational trainer “Bradley” (Carl Lumbly) an invitation to the White House. That’s where the wheels really do come off as their pal starts taking potshots at the President and we discover that the erstwhile somewhat militaristic and temperamental “Ross” and “Cap” aren’t exactly on the same page. It’s pretty obvious that there’s a third party pulling the strings so it’s going to need all of his patience and guile if the shielded wonder is to retrieve his mentor from solitary, rebuild his relationship with his president before that man really sees red, and also get to the bottom of a dastardly scheme that seems bent on causing international strife between the USA and Japan. Mackie’s a charismatic man and he does what he can with this, but the story comes across as little more than an hybrid of “Top Gun” (1986) meets “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997) with an unremarkable cast, including Ford’s “Ross”, that struggles to make any impact as it races along for two hours without presenting anything original or particularly entertaining. It passes the time, but is yet another bland offering from a studio that is increasingly resorting to it’s creative technicians to design something that looks great but resonates not remotely. Disappointing, sorry.",6.0

 ""Captain America: Brave New World may not reach the high bar set by its direct predecessors, but it's far from the disaster some claim it to be.
 
 Despite its evident production flaws, Julius Onah still manages to deliver moments of real entertainment, supported by a charismatic cast and well-crafted action sequences. Most importantly, Anthony Mackie's performance as Sam Wilson proves, without a doubt, that he was the right choice to wield the shield left behind by Steve Rogers. The actor perfectly captures the duality of being both a global symbol and a man still searching for his own path, bringing a unique approach to the legacy of the titular hero.
 
 It may not be top-tier MCU, but it's a film worthy of being experienced on the big screen.""

822119,67cd1aa742c7521252f5d691,Hadam10Rose,"While I find it the same general quality of a majority of what Marvel has put out, it is a flawed film with moments you could tell were caused from one of the many reshoots they did of the film. (It was shot 4 times) One funny example is when Cap and Falcon are on the run they ""ditch their smart phones"" so they can't be tracked. Leaving them in their offices. On the Car ride to their destination, Falcon isn't wearing a watch. Then at the destination he's wearing a Smart Watch. You know something that can be tracked..... Anyway it was off putting to have Hulk's cast and Villains but not included him, at all. Not even a photo, just ""old news footage"" from the Harlem battle. Mr Blue doesn't even mention Bruce at all. Instead blaming everything on Ross.
 
 What the film did have, I'm sure it makes much more since if you watched Falcon&Winter Solider, but if you didn't they sort of explain things in the film. At least the short 1 dialogue explain it way. The ending battle was a, what the heck? Move and what happened to the President make little Legal since, although in one cut of the film he died. Because Bruce nor She Hulk are in prison, so at best they would keep him locked up until he learned to control it. As the illegal thing he did was, what the Accords already did, keeping a dangerous super locked up. Not very well, but still the same thing. Definitely not as bad as some say it is, but not joining the few MCU films I will rewatch or rewatch over and over again. I give it a C-",

 Its ""safe"", by the numbers, US rules the world, superhero narrative, is wholly familiar. I will add, I was disappointed by the effort to portray Israel in a positive light, given their appalling behaviour on the world stage. 
 
 Anyway, what you can expect is a predominantly exposition driven affair, with lots of action and CGI eye candy with light character development.
 
 I will add, viewed superficially its quite watchable but its by no means compelling or thought provoking.

822119,68121d809862082665a0eb43,jarry90,"Captain America: Brave New World was overall an enjoyable watch, even if it had a few noticeable flaws. Anthony Mackie truly shines in this film as Sam Wilson, more so than in his previous appearances. He brings charisma, sincerity, and depth to the role of Captain America in a way that finally feels fully realized. The supporting cast was equally strong, though Harrison Ford’s portrayal of President Thaddeus Ross, while solid, came across as a bit stiff and frankly, as if he was a little too old for the role. He did bring gravitas, but it sometimes felt like he lacked the physical presence the character demanded.
 
 However, the film stumbled in a few areas that impacted my overall enjoyment. My main gripe was with the final battle sequence. Sam Wilson, a fully human character without the super-soldier serum, directly confronting and battling a Hulk-level threat stretched believability too far. It felt unrealistic even by Marvel standards, detracting from the otherwise solid storytelling.
 
 The subplot involving Sam debating whether or not to take the super-soldier serum was also underwhelming and repetitive. We've seen similar storylines explored before in the MCU, and this didn't add much new depth or meaningful insight into Sam’s character. It seemed to slow down the momentum rather than enhance the narrative.
 
 Another puzzling choice was the extensive callbacks to 2008’s The Incredible Hulk. Given the significant differences in tone, actors, and general feel, the tie-ins felt forced and disconnected. The reliance on such an old and somewhat obscure MCU entry was distracting and didn’t resonate emotionally.
 
 Despite these flaws, there was plenty to like. The film's pacing was mostly good, the action sequences well-choreographed, and visually, it delivered exactly what you'd expect from Marvel. Red Hulk was very cool when he finally appeared, and his presence boosted the film's overall entertainment value.
 
 In short, Captain America: Brave New World is worth watching for Marvel fans, particularly for its strong characters and compelling action. However, Marvel needs to either commit to realistic storytelling for human-level heroes or provide them with suitable enhancements or foes. A solid film, but not without its clear areas for improvement.",

The plot is simple yet clever, unfolding naturally without unnecessary complexity. It keeps things engaging with steady character development, making you feel connected to the leads as their situation evolves. While some critics seem to take the romance out of context, it actually makes perfect sense within the story. It’s not just there for the sake of it but develops realistically based on their circumstances. Sure, there are some plot holes, but unless you're watching just to nitpick, they don’t take away from the experience.
 
 Visually, the movie stands out with dramatic lighting and smart camera work that keeps you immersed. Even daytime scenes carry a certain mood that adds to the film’s atmosphere. The cinematography is well thought out, with the right angles capturing the emotional depth of the characters while also making the action sequences hit hard. Speaking of action, while there’s plenty of it, the movie does lean more into its emotional core rather than being a full-on action spectacle. The CGI is solid, blending in naturally without feeling overdone, and while some moments might remind you of other films, it never feels like a cheap copy.
 
 The performances are strong, with both leads carrying the entire movie effortlessly. Their chemistry feels real, and their dialogue doesn’t come off as forced or unnatural. The script is well executed, moving the story forward at the right pace without dragging things out. The music and sound design complement the film nicely, enhancing key moments without overpowering them. Overall, The Gorge has a high rewatch factor, the kind of movie you'd want to show a friend just to experience it again.

 Lets get the negatives out of the way. An absurdly illogical story, filled with characters who do improbable, often stupid things. A lack of clear direction in terms of what the story is supposed to be, a love story, an action thriller, a horror, fantasy, sci fi tale?
 
 Oddly, I would argue its the creative cocktail of discordant genres and elements, that actually helps this film succeed. Firstly, ""The Gorge"" works wonderfully as a romance. The chemistry between the key characters sparkles with humour, quirkiness and passion. It functions too, as a fantasy horror, sci fi, thriller with highly creative story and action aspects, that come together beautifully. CGI is only okay but it operates well enough, to make things creepily exciting. 
 
 In summary, I enjoyed this film. Its compelling, exciting, likeable and inherently watchable, in spite of its often glaring shortcomings. My advice, take a look and see if you agree.",7.0

 Scott is his usual acting self. He isnt awful, but not really that great either. BUT as proven before, when Adkins is paired with great material he does become serviceable.

 However, there is a noticeable tone shift when going from non-action to action. While admittedly, this becomes less of a problem by the 2nd half.

From what? Well it turns out she is a bit of a miraculous conception from the ""Lockwood"" dynasty that co-founded the original park with ""Hammond"" and is very much on the radar of corporate megalomanic ""Dodgson"" (Campbell Scott) whose company is devising super-engineered locusts to devour great swathes of crops across the United States that are not grown from their own brand of seed. This is where ""Sattler"" (Laura Dern) comes in. She is convinced of this dastardly plan, but must compare the DNA of one from his lab with one they secured in the wild so she can prove it. Her plan enlists the help of old pal ""Grant"" (Sam Neill) and with the help of their intellectual nemesis ""Malcolm"" (a suitably contrarian effort from Jeff Goldblum) they secure an invitation to the company's sanctuary in the Italian Dolomites. Meantime, the young girl is abducted from her wintry home, as is the baby of velociraptor ""Blue"" and so Pratt and Howard have to track them down, and that takes them on some quickly paced, but hardly original, set piece adventures where they meet pilot ""Kayla"" (DeWanda Wise). She chips in to help them in what now reminded me of aspects of the Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" films, before they also end up in the Italian mountains. Can they team up and thwart the cunning plan? The problem with this, is that there are just way too many characters and too many weakly constructed threads to the story going on. It's all too diffuse and serendipity in the last hour or so just takes far too great a hand in the way the narrative combines and develops. The dinosaur effects are still amazing, but oddly enough I felt them less effective than in previous iterations - there just aren't enough scenes that feature them and when they do, they are just under-used. Pratt is always good value for me, but here he looks out of sorts and hardly features at all; Scott just doesn't cut it as the malevolent baddie (though could his character be the same guy who tried to buy the specimens in the first film?) and Sam Neill relies too much on his bemused facial expressions - indeed his best work on this is pretty much all included in the trailers. It looks great on big screen, includes a few bars now and again from John Williams masterful 1993 score, but for the main part this is a pretty mediocre conclusion to a great franchise with an ending that is rushed and entirely predictable.",6.0

 ""Jurassic World Dominion is a massive disappointment on virtually every level. With an incredibly captivating premise, Colin Trevorrow ignores the fascinating years of mankind trying to deal with the chaos of dinosaurs repopulating Earth, opting instead to write a generic, formulaic, surprisingly tedious screenplay.
 
 In addition to the lousy character treatment, the cast is divided into two storylines focused on nonsensical, bland rescue and espionage missions, placing dinosaurs on the back burner during the excessively long runtime.
 
 Action sequences reach drastically low entertainment levels, sometimes imperceptible due to erratic camera work and choppy editing.
 
 The cast, visuals, and score might save this from being a complete trainwreck, but not from miserably failing to deliver an epic conclusion to a saga that deserved nothing less than that.""
 
 Rating: D",3.0
507086,62ab3776134d5800998353d7,Chris Sawin,"With _Jurassic World Dominion_, a _Jurassic World_ film where dinosaurs are now free and interacting with the modern world shouldn’t feel this long-winded or this tiresome. There are a few action sequences that are worthwhile and Jeff Goldblum has a few great one-liners (“You made a promise to a dinosaur?”), but the film is a monumental disappointment overall.
 
 The film has already made over $415 million at the worldwide box office, so the interest in the franchise is still there. But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction. Now that all of the nostalgia is out of the way, fans deserve a refreshing and unique adventure over what is otherwise a glorified rehash.

507086,62cef4538a84d200502b989c,r96sk,"<em>'Jurassic World Dominion'</em> is far from perfect, if just about entertaining to watch... kinda.
 
 I'm not fully convinced by it but I do think there's enough in there that's worth watching. There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.
 
 Still, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.
 
 The run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.
 
 I'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.",7.0
507086,62efd1217d5504007e4b6dc7,Peter McGinn,"So after watching the first four movies in this franchise (three of which I had seen more than once, I finally watched this most recent effort. There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier ones.
 
 It held some of the usual elements: a child for us to care when they placed her in danger; the ability of the heroes (even the child) to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic; walking dinosaur food, also known as bad guys; and references to the original theme park that started it all. They outdid themselves this time - keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canister.
 
 Of course, there are plenty of differences also. Parts of it weren’t even recognizable as part of the franchise. They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs, the ethics of genetic engineering, a child clone kidnapping, industrial malfeasance, and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film: the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to co-exist under the new planetary paradigm. 
 
 Another difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the film.
 
 An improvement is the return of characters we know well: Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back, and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms, unlike in the last movie.
 
 So ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it, though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way.",6.0

507086,6355353c880c9200796de089,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Well, the dinosaur special effects are quite decent. Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.
 
 I really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen “big companies are bad” story with dinosaurs thrown in.
 
 The story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the “heroes” fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the “heroes” doesn’t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?
 
 Idiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.
 
 They brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.
 
 It is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today’s Hollywood morons. I’ve been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie. It is not a good movie, plain and simple.",4.0

 As dinosaurs freely roam the Earth, Owen & Claire (Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard) seek to find their kidnapped adopted daughter (Isabella Sermon), which takes them to Malta and then a remote dinosaur preserve in the Dolomite Mountains of northeastern Italy. Meanwhile Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant (Laura Dern and Sam Neill) have serious concerns about the remote facility wherein they reunite with Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).
    
 ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" (2022) isn’t great like the previous “Fallen Kingdom” (2018) and is arguably the least of the second trilogy. There are some Indiana Jones elements in the Malta segment and James Bond bits at the technologically advanced lair in the mountains, both of which I appreciate.
 
 Yet I strangely never bought the characters as real people. They always struck me as actors performing according to a contrived script, which tries too hard to check the diversity boxes. Still, there’s certainly enough here to entertain if you’re interested in a dinosaur-oriented sci-fi adventure.  
 
 The film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, with the Extended Version running just over 12 minutes longer (I viewed the latter). The primary shooting locations include British Columbia, Malta, Hawaii and the UK (Pinewood Studios).
 
 GRADE: B-/C+",6.0
507086,64078c81ae26be00d84727c3,Axel,"Jurassic World Dominion fails to impress as a dinosaur movie, as the plot seems to be a poor choice. The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt's character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.
 
 The camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.
 
 Overall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch. 
 
 Additionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience's attention. The story's predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.
 
 As if to acknowledge the franchise's overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm's line, ""Jurassic World? Not a fan,"" serves as a meta-commentary on the movie itself. It is a nod to the fans who have been disappointed by the franchise's recent offerings, and unfortunately, Jurassic World Dominion does little to change that sentiment. 5/10",5.0

I always like a good antagonist, but sadly we just know that however dastardly and evil he - in this case the ultra-hammy Jim Carrey - can be, no writer or director is ever going to let him win, and that's pretty efficiently telegraphed right from the start of this sequel that's going to be a prequel too, no doubt. Some of the writing is quite fun, with plenty of contemporary and quite sarcastic references to raise a smile, and there are homages paid aplenty to just about everyone from ""007"" and the ""Fantastic Four"" to the ""Avengers"" - but in the end it's all just a little too shiny and predicable.

Thing is, she’s got no fin key so has to borrow one from the friendly “Tucker” (Jai Courtney) whom we already know is a bit of a wrong ‘un.

Well, sadly there just isn’t anything about this that leaves any doubt about the conclusion, and the episodic, start/stop/start again nature of the storytelling just strings us along with a series of implausible scenarios that pad it out with all the certainty of the undoubted denouement. Aided by some impressive underwater photography, this could have been quite a fun half hour if Sean Byrne had had the courage of his original convictions and just let the initial impetus do the work, but once the thing starts to repeat itself it just becomes a bit preposterous as serendipity takes just too great and frequent a role.

The action, mainly the climax, and flying shots in this film also show how great the animation is. The main thing about the animation that is amazing is how the dragons look. They all look like real, kinda cartoonish, dragons that come across as vicious but also cute. The cinematography in this film is stunning. The lighting in each and every scene was chosen correctly for it. I really like the score in this film that was done by John Powell. The music in the film just helped bring you into this fantasy world of Vikings and dragons. Now my main problem is mainly the casting of the voice actors. They all did great jobs as their roles but I think some of them would have been better casted if their character was older and not a teenager. That can mainly be seen with Hiccup who is supposed to be a teenager but sounds like an adult who already went through puberty. I also had a few issues with the pacing in this film. Some scenes were way too short and I would have liked to have seen them a tiny bit longer. Now I do get that it’s a film made for children but as long as there’s moving objects on screen kids won’t care what’s happening in the movie.

 The story was really enjoyable, it is a standard embrace that you are different and you will be stronger. However, I think it works well here. Hiccup is not a strong viking like the rest of his village, but he is very smart. He uses that to observe dragons, learn how to live with them and help them. Which, in some way does make him a better fighter but he doesn’t want to kill them. 
 
 There are many tropes in this movie, like the one I mentioned above. However, the writers really lift them in a way that they feel fresh again. 
 
 The rest of the character roster have a simple characterization, but again they have depth. The movie does not have a lot of time, but it really makes the most out of it.
 
 It also does not underestimate the viewer, there are plenty of scenes where there is no dialogue. Which makes sense, considering dragons don't understand human language. Those scenes are probably my favorite, those little changes really stick over the course of the movie. They tell a story which words never could.
 
 There are some moments where you have to suspend your belief. For example the final fight does feel a bit much for a group of teenagers, but it does feel earned. Throughout the movie we see their daily practice, and we do see their strengths and weakness. While also having very little knowledge of how to fly a dragon, which is also evident in the fight scene. On top of that we also see a character actually suffer consequences, which is rarely seen in this type of media. That part is quite refreshing and a good reminder that our main cast is not invincible. 
 
 The animation was also really good and there were many beautiful scenes. I think the animators really outdid themselves with the visuals.

The young “Hiccup” is quite inventive though, and he devises a contraption that despite the scorn and derision of his friends, he reckons might by capture the ultimate in dragonry - the “Night Fury”. Suffice to say he proves just a bit more successful than he had anticipated and so now has to try and do what it says on the posters.

 The movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).
 
 Their success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.
 
 Things take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.
 
 Riley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.
 
 The new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.
 
 Forced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley’s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.
 
 The movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.
 
 The film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

""Riley"" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like ""Fear"", ""Joy"" and ""Anger"" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. ""Anger"" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic ""Ennui"" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in.

1022789,66732d170db8b2a0d56eac29,MannyD,"Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!

1022789,668d477e9d1b57031f5c0507,TheSceneSnobs,"When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.
 
 I can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.
 
 The sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke’s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler’s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.
 
 The story’s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.
 
 Some interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. 
 
 Amy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke’s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn’t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children’s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.
 
 Inside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.
 
 If you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley’s journey. It’s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",8.0
1022789,669b5f392294f2f7fdde9851,minion196,"""Inside Out 2"" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.
 
 The film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler’s Joy and Phyllis Smith’s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.",
1022789,67246aa4c1212313ac7ebcb3,moviepoptime,"Inside Out 2 is a suggestion to follow Riley’s troubles during adolescence, which adds new characters to this animated movie – Anxiety and Envy, – besides Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl’s mind. Compared to ‘Toy Story 2,’ it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.
 
 I also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary. It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision-making when you’re in trouble.

1241436,68050253276bf64e41aa882b,CinemaSerf,"A squad of American soldiers seemingly randomly select an house in Ramadi and having relocated it’s sleeping occupants to the ground floor, set up a sniper station from where they can monitor the goings on around them. Initially, this all looks harmless enough as the Iraqi locals go about their business, but gradually the spotters become suspicious of repetitive activity, the odd person who seems to be snooping on them - and then, well all hell breaks loose leaving them facing an existential threat that will test their mettle, their equipment and require some feats of legerdemain if they are to survive long enough to be rescued. There is quite some intensity to this drama as the young men under siege must each deal with their fears, strengths and weaknesses under a constant stream of fire. Will Poulter’s “Erik” leads the team, but the best effort for me came from his comms man “Ray” (D’Pharoah Woon-A-Tai) and, though sparingly, from Kit Connor’s rookie “Tommy” who, like us watching, had no idea what they were doing in this house and what the purpose of their mission actually was in the first place. There isn’t so much a script as an increasingly nervous dialogue that disintegrates as their predicament becomes more perilous and the photography and particularly the audio serve really well in conveying a sense of the lethally claustrophobic atmosphere in which these men had to function. Real veterans wrote the story, advised the production and that shows in something that is certainly incomplete from a narrative perspective, but is uncomfortably enthralling to watch and graphically displays the horrors of urban warfare.",7.0

The plot being told in real time makes it rather captivating too, the tone of either trepidation or torment is omnipresent.
 
 Well, I say omnipresent, that's taking out the opening scene. I was not expecting that! Very fun though and a good way to show a snapshot of the camaraderie. It shouldn't work because it's not like it matches the rest of the film, but I gotta say I really loved it. What a tune, by the way.
 
 It's a fairly stacked cast list, from Will Poulter to Joseph Quinn to Charles Melton to Michael Gandolfini to D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai.

 Warfare can be dull, even bureaucratic, with its own language, spoken over radio in codes. Equally, its frenetic, violent and horribly visceral. 
 
 We see all of these aspects of war, in this film. I'll admit its depressing, sad, underlining in blood, the wastefulness of war. Mind you, that's what war is. Not heroic, symphonic, grandiose. 
 
 Suffice to say, I liked this film. Its unpretentious and makes you question, not only the need for war but attempts to make it appear noble, when clearly, its nothing of the kind.
 
 In summary, a realistic portrayal of the true face of war. Something every young person, thinking of joining the military, should watch.",7.0

 ""Warfare is a film you admire more than you enjoy. Its anti-narrative structure, slow pacing, and lack of strong central figures make it difficult to revisit - but impossible to forget.
 
 It's a remarkable display of technical realism, a brutally honest recreation of a war zone, and a testament to cinema's power when it refuses to play by the rules. Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza may not have crafted a universally captivating masterpiece, but they've created something undeniably authentic.

533535,66a2d90909905455146125df,r96sk,"Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em> an excellent watch!
 
 There are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.
 
 Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.
 
 As noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original?

533535,66a57e4af88446bc9819d138,Brent Marchant,"In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",6.0

533535,66a7359905adb834423a4076,CinemaSerf,"Well the ""Deadpool"" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old ""Dead"". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed ""Wolverine/Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing ""Paradox"" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down ""Cassandra Nova"" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of ""Xavier"" who presides over the void. That's a ""Mad Max"" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by ""Paradox"" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",7.0
533535,66a91183037c3bc76b5c4625,TheSceneSnobs,"Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.
 
 Reynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.
 
 The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.
 
 The film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.
 
 Despite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.
 
 This isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool’s irreverent humor doesn’t clash with the MCU’s established tone.
 
 Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It’s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",8.0

 Marvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.

The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.
 
 If you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. 
 
 Overall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss. And don't forget to stick around for the mid-credits and end-credits scenes for an extra dose of fun and closure to the film. Enjoy the laugh-filled ride!",9.0

 From the very beginning, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ bursts onto the screen with the chaotic energy and irreverent humor fans have come to expect from the Merc with a Mouth. This film feels like a love letter to comic book enthusiasts, seamlessly blending the zany, fourth-wall-breaking antics of Deadpool with the gritty, emotionally charged presence of Wolverine. The movie captures the essence of reading a comic book, where big, crazy choices and wild action sequences keep you at the edge of your seat. The introduction of variants and a plethora of cameos from beloved characters across the Marvel Universe only enhances this feeling, making it a true spectacle for long-time fans.
 
 Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is nothing short of iconic, and this film allows him to fully embrace the character in ways we’ve longed to see. The sight of Wolverine finally donning his classic costume and charging on all fours is a visual treat that elicited cheers from the audience. Jackman’s performance is a testament to his deep connection with the character, proving once again why he's considered one of the best actors of our time.
 
 Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is as quippy and meta as ever, and the film strikes a delicate balance between humor and heart. The emotional depth is surprising, particularly in scenes where _Deadpool and Wolverine_ share poignant moments. One standout is Deadpool's farewell to Wolverine, which is both a nod to the characters' shared history and a poignant reminder of their enduring bond.
 
 The film's action sequences are top-tier, with choreography that respects each character's unique fighting style. The inclusion of characters like Elektra, Blade, and even a hilarious cameo from Gambit adds layers of excitement and nostalgia. Wesley Snipes' return as Blade, complete with his signature line, ""Some motherfuckers always trying to ice-skate uphill,"" received one of the loudest reactions from the audience.
 
 The story navigates the complexities of timelines and multiverse mechanics with a wink and a nod, never bogging down in overly technical explanations. This approach keeps the focus on the characters and their journeys, making for a more engaging and enjoyable experience.
 
 _Deadpool & Wolverine_ isn't just a comic book movie; it's a celebration of the Marvel Universe's rich history and a heartfelt send-off to characters we've grown to love over the years. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual viewer, this film is an emotional whirlwind that invokes nostalgia and opens your heart to the possibilities you imagined as a kid. It's a fitting tribute to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and a testament to the enduring appeal of Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool. This movie is sure to be remembered as one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a true comic book dream realized on the big screen.",8.0
829557,63b4d9ad391b9c0083c2037e,r96sk,"Undoubtedly still awful viewing, but... I found it a tiny bit more watchable than its predecessor.
 
 <em>'365 Days: This Day'</em> still has nothing that even closely resembles a plot, still has extremely limited actors and still shouldn't even exist. However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!
 
 Unlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 
 There's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise?

 Oh, that's beautiful: two people (?) sitting in the sunset, both beautiful, the guy has a tattoo on his palm, nowhere else (Redflag!!), she stares deeply in love at his quivering lips. The male lead looks as if the coke delivery from the wholesaler hasn't arrived, she's naked again. And then, wow, that look - like someone fell asleep on Instagram's sepia filter slider. Everything looks so beautifully even.
 
 In addition, the lovely sounds of the best that the German charts have to offer jingle from positions 58 to 72. Is it always the same song? Or lots of them that always sound the same? Is it even music or has someone kicked the neighbor's cat in the shin again? I don't know it. But no time to think. One of the mega hot soft sex games is just beginning, which is always really nasty and unpleasant.
 
 It's sooo romantic. She says “Fuck me”, he says nothing as usual, but his look has now changed from a coke hit to a stroke. And then he licks it. Oh, great. With the whole tongue, once across the face and the adjacent table leg. Luckily, the endless banter is filmed in super slow motion, so the torture...cinematic ecstasy lasts much, much longer.
 
 Suddenly he says... no, that's not true, he doesn't say anything. We only speak here in emergencies. Even if there's probably some kind of mafia plot being told, which I overlooked in all the constant fucking around. Unfortunately, I didn't understand who all these people were until the end. Well, of course it's stupid that I didn't see the first part, but it's also a little bit unusual that this sequel doesn't make any effort to give these characters any depth. Or to explain what is actually going on here. Is anything even going on? Well, it doesn't matter. The guys are supposed to be cute and the women are supposed to be persistent and stupid. And oh - they start slobbering on each other again 😍😍😍

 “365 Days - This Day” is like “Fifty Shades of Gray” for sexually frustrated amoebas like Dr. RTL2's summer question page is filmed as if the Netflix executive suite was personally shitting in your brain, in slow motion. Infuriatingly misogynistic, absurdly badly acted and of course at number 1 on the Netflix charts. When is there a power outage when you need one?",
829557,66d4fb0a4827b3abd8180978,tmdb51616167,"If I were in the mood to watch adult content, Netflix would definitely not be my first choice. The movie I stumbled upon was a total disaster, making me extremely uncomfortable, especially when children unexpectedly walked into the room. It was a messy experience that I strongly advise against.
 
 ""365 Days"" seems to be all about sex and trying to engage the audience solely on that basis. The sequel follows the same pattern, and both films are filled with excessive plot holes, acting issues, and seem to lack a meaningful storyline. It feels like they are veering towards the wrong direction, almost resembling pornography rather than a film with substance.
 
 Despite being somewhat enjoyable, these movies left me questioning why they were even made. I only watched the sequel because I had seen the first one and felt compelled to review both at the same time, even though I found them both to be quite terrible.",1.0

If you are a frequent user of Tumblr, you'll want to capture SO many moments in .gif format. If you've never seen the first movie, you'll still love this movie, or at least, like it.
 
 Essentially, this movie is great. It has all that a child could desire in a film (trust me, the kids in the theatre LOVED it - it was super cute) and it also had some absolutely hilarious moments for the adults. The plot is pretty good; even if it is predictable, it's predictable in a way that works. The animation is gorgeous. The voicework is awesome. The way all of the characters have grown over the 5 year gap between the two movies in the series was really well done and evident, not just in appearance, but also in their personalities and interactions with each other.
 
 In any case it was a lot of fun! Go watch it, even if you don't have kids.",
82702,55464003925141499f003038,Reno,"Like I said a couple of year ago during 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' review, it's a terrible title for a sequel. The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.
 
 This part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.
 
 Like I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it.

82702,56f3f9c2c3a3682fcf002e66,Andres Gomez,"The first one was good and the second is not any worse.
 
 This series is standing out of the pack for its complex plot involving several topics, not just the typical ones in an animated movie. Arguably, they have been also treated in former movies; two main characters which are crippled (Finding Nemo ...), greater involvement of strong female roles (although, still, not as main characters and utterly in need of help from the male roles), ecology, etc.
 
 The points I dislike the most is the speech of homeland being the good ""peacekeeper"" nation forced to use violence to keep it (peace). Quite hypocritical but, clearly, addressed to the US audience.
 
 The repetitive line of story about the (nerd) hero who is the only one to save the world is quite tiresome too.
 
 Finally, how lightly some other traumatic causing topics are treated: finding that a parent abandoned their child, death, etc ...
 
 In any case, this is a good movie, funny and with an interesting story. Worth watching for a franchise that, I think, doesn't have all the attention it should have.",8.0

157336,5463856c0e0a267815002598,Reno,"Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.
 
 As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.
 
 It all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.
 
 As I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.
 
 The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.
 
 There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.
 
 ‘‘This world's a treasure,
 but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’
 
 All the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.
 
 Remember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.
 
 Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.
 
 I could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.
 
 ‘‘Maybe we've spent too long
 trying to figure all this out with theory.’’
 
 The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.
 
 The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.
 
 It will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",9.0

 Interstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.
 I remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. 
 Since then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.

 The cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...
 
 * The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.
 * There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.
 * To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.

 IT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.
 
 This movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.
 
 The premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.
 
 Mathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.
 
 Interstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.
 
 The visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.
 
 Alas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.
 
 With all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.

157336,58a46707c3a3686cc200458c,shaunfrombklyn,"This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. 
 
 The story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.
 
 But what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this.

Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.
 
 Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.
 
 The movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.
 
 The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!
 
 The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.
 
 The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?

 Interstellar is my favorite movie. I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. 
 The soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!
 The movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it.

 Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called ""Interstellar"" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I've had at the cinema.
 
 I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.
 
 The visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won an Oscar yet.
 
 Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it.
 
 My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.
 
 Overall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.",9.0
157336,6180ea233e2ec8008d18ddfb,Peter McGinn,"I will not add another in depth review to the several I see here on this movie. Nor will I try to evaluate the accuracy of the science behind the plot. Apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.
 
 But I have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn’t insult my intelligence. In the movie Monsters, for example, I read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. Fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.
 
 So the human story of Interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. I have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in Interstellar as well.
 
 Oh, and I say it is entertainment rather than a documentary, but it is not light entertainment. If you want to give this movie a fair chance, give it your full attention. It is not Mars Attacks, where you can watch it while distracted by life and still pick up on  plot details.",9.0

Mystery arrives after a sand storm leaves some magnetic clues to a secret location inhabited by NASA scientists led by ""Brand"" (Sir Michael Caine) who manage to convince former pilot ""Coop"" to join a mission to go into space and, using a recently detected wormhole that he believes may have been deliberately sent to help mankind rescue itself, set off to find another home for us all. Leaving a seriously narked daughter behind, he accepts the mission and together with the daughter of ""Brand"" (Anne Hathaway) their perilous trek begins. This is a more solid sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan. Though it features doses of his usual time bending scenarios, for the most part it is an exciting action film with mishaps a-plenty as their mission sees danger at just about every junction. There is a decent chemistry between Hathaway and McConaughey allowing the characters to develop with some depth that helps to draw us into to their efforts. The visual effects are superb, it has TARS - a rather clunkily designed robot that proves a whizz when running and rescuing, and the ending has something of the Escher drawing to it. The narrative can be thought provoking offering quite an interesting series of choices, especially when Matt Damon (""Mann"") joins the story and begins to challenge their approach to just what ""humanity"" might actually be! A host of celebrated co-stars prop it up well. John Lithgow is effective as the patriarch of the family and Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley help diffuse the intensity of the principal relationship as the space-bound menace gradually accumulates. It's all but three hours long, and there is no denying that it hits a barren spell at times during the middle hour, but for my money this is a Nolan film that does not over-complicate itself and is as good a science fiction thriller as I've seen in many a year.",7.0

 So glad to finally tick <em>'Interstellar'</em> off my theoretical list, took me far too long to get around to it but boy am I glad I finally have done - sensational film! The most obvious sign of that being the case is how the ~2hr30min run time goes by in an absolute flash... <em>*insert joke about it like being aboard Endurance here*</em>
 
 I'm obviously not able to add anything new to what many, many others have already said gushingly about this 2014 flick, so I can only say I'm sure I agree with the vast majority of whatever praise this has received. As one would expect from Christopher Nolan & Co., it's incredibly well made, sounds amazing and looks out-of-this-world (ha!) stunning.
 
 Matthew McConaughey puts in an incredible performance as lead, most notably nailing all of the emotion-filled scenes - not that I care about these things personally, but I'm shocked to see the lack of high accolades that came his way from this... he merited more! Aside from him, there are very good showings from the likes of Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy and Anne Hathaway.
 
 I will note one 'but', mind. I didn't love the bits at the end involving the dimensional tesseract, don't get me wrong at all it's still superb viewing... just a noticeable drop from all that preceeds it, which honestly simply says more about how outstanding everything else prior is really. I thought similarly about (the equally magnificent) <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/"" rel=""nofollow"">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>'</em>, for example.

157336,6674de0367e8c4e89b4ed8d2,madriyanto,"Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" (2014) isn't just a science fiction film; it's a cinematic experience that transcends genre boundaries. It's a breathtaking exploration of humanity's yearning for survival, the profound power of love, and the awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe.
 
 The film's greatest strength lies in its seamless blend of a deeply personal story with cutting-edge scientific concepts. We follow Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot turned farmer, who is chosen to lead a mission to find a new home for humanity. The film doesn't shy away from complex scientific ideas like wormholes, black holes, and the theory of relativity, but it presents them in a way that is both accessible and captivating. The scene where Cooper encounters his aged daughter while he himself remains relatively young is a poignant example of how the film masterfully intertwines science and emotion, leaving viewers pondering the nature of time and the enduring power of familial bonds.
 
 ""Interstellar"" is not for the casual viewer. It demands attention, patience, and a willingness to engage with complex ideas. The film's pacing is deliberate, its visuals are stunningly immersive, and its themes are profound. It's a film that rewards repeated viewings, as each watch unveils new layers of meaning and scientific detail. The film's impact is further amplified by Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which perfectly captures the vastness of space and the weight of humanity's fate.
 
 Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a sense of awe and wonder that is both captivating and emotionally resonant. McConaughey delivers a nuanced performance as Cooper, a man grappling with the weight of his mission and the sacrifices he must make. The supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, also deliver compelling performances that further elevate the film's emotional impact.
 
 ""Interstellar"" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the power of human ingenuity, the enduring nature of love, and the endless possibilities that lie beyond our planet. It's a film that reminds us of our place in the universe, and the profound interconnectedness of all things. For those who appreciate thought-provoking science fiction with a strong emotional core, ""Interstellar"" is an absolute must-see.",9.0
157336,6761a88ab80a974245cbef0e,RalphRahal,"""Interstellar"" is easily one of the best movies I’ve ever watched, definitely in my top 5 of all time. It’s a masterpiece that feels like every scene matters. Each moment carries an important message, whether it’s about love, sacrifice, or the endless curiosity of humans to explore the unknown. It’s not just a movie, it’s an experience.
 
 The performances by the actors were amazing. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper really made me feel every bit of his emotions; his love for his kids, his struggle, and his determination to save humanity. Anne Hathaway also nailed her role, and Jessica Chastain, as adult Murph, was just perfect. Even the smaller roles added so much depth to the movie. It felt like everyone gave their absolute best.
 
 Christopher Nolan’s direction? Flawless. You can see how much thought and care he put into every part of the movie. The production was top-notch, and the visuals of space were breathtaking. Even the robots, TARS and CASE, felt real and practical, not just fancy CGI. Fun fact: those robots were real models controlled by an actor, which is crazy to think about! The black hole, Gargantua, was also scientifically accurate thanks to physicist Kip Thorne, and it looked stunning on screen.
 
 The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer deserves its own shoutout. The way he used the church organ and ticking sounds created a mood that’s unforgettable. It felt like the music was alive and part of the story, pulling me deeper into every scene.
 
 The movie also taught me things. I love how it’s based on real science, like time dilation and wormholes, but it doesn’t feel boring or like a science lesson. Instead, it made me curious and left me thinking long after it ended.
 
 One thing that stood out for me is how the movie shows the power of love and connection. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph was the heart of the story for me. It reminded me that even in the vastness of space, what truly matters are the people we care about.
 
 ""Interstellar"" isn’t just about saving the world; it’s about what it means to be human. Watching it makes you think about big questions: Why are we here? What’s our purpose? And how far are we willing to go for the ones we love? It’s rare to find a movie that’s this entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking all at the same time.
 
 This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over again and still find new details to appreciate. It’s honestly hard to put into words how much I love it, but if you’ve seen it, you know what I mean. It’s a masterpiece that stays with you.",10.0

 **Full review:** https://bit.ly/Grupid",
519182,668d480067947cfba5314de5,TheSceneSnobs,"There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.
 
 One of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.
 
 The film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. 
 
 While my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.
 
 If there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",6.0

The family ""Gru"" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis ""Maxime Le Mal"" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, ""Silas"" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty ""Poppy"" knows the secret and blackmails ""Gru"" into helping her pinch ""Lenny"" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive ""Principal Übelschlecht"" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with ""Maxime"" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced ""Super Minions"" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now.

519182,66971032e148afad96c108b9,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"The goofy Minions are on the loose again in “Despicable Me 4,” a lazy sequel that does little more to advance the franchise other than embodying the old adage of “style over substance” to a fault. There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.
 
 Former supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy. Their peaceful routine is sent into chaos when the evil Maxime Le Mal (voice of Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend Valentina (voice of Sofía Vergara) escape from prison and set their sights on a new nemesis and potential target: Gru. This forces the family to go on the run and assume new identities in the suburbs.
 
 The plot is basic and sounds like it could be a lot of fun with its fish out of water spin. Unfortunately, very little is done with the story. The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.
 
 The introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film). Everything else is a shallow gimmick as the movie struggles to maintain momentum. At least it’s true to the “Despicable Me” canon, but the film also shows that there’s only so much you can do with these characters and this universe. Move along: there’s nothing original to see here.

 One minute we're watching gru back in the AVL capturing another infamous villain thats known gru since high school. Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.
 
 No joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. 
 
 Even the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?
 
 On a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age?

 What makes these films work is simple fast paced, frenetic action combined with top class choreography. This film certainly has most of these elements but it doesn't work as well. Why? 
 
 Perhaps its biggest short coming is its not especially cohesive. It builds and diffuses its much needed pace.This is not helped at all by  jumping between geographical locations and complicating the team dynamic. 
 
 The main character behaving like a medieval vassal, getting on his knees at one point to beg to keep a case, didn't impress either. Nor does, the at times, rather lame humour,that feels tacked on.
 
 On the upside what remains is moderately entertaining but its not enough to really see this iteration shine.
 
 In summary, not every film in any franchise can be a winner. The Roundup: Punishment is not awful but its not all that good either.",6.0

It had me laughing my ass off and had some pretty decent kills for a PG-13 film, although I think it could have been even better with a hard R rating.
 
 But this film is not just a dark horror comedy, it dives deeper than its surface appeal. Deep down there is intimate social commentary on parents using technology as a crutch. Whenever M3GAN is in the room, Gemma finds it easier to neglect her niece and let's M3GAN take control of the parenting. This makes it much harder for her to get a genuine connection with her to fulfill motherly needs. I found this surprisingly compelling and really does have a genuine impact in today's society, obviously not with life size android dolls but with tablets and phones. Really enjoyed this aspect of the film.
 
 Allison Williams delivered a pretty decent performance; it was nice to see her in another prominent horror role since Get Out. Violet McGraw once again was great as an inspiring child actress; her filmography is beginning to be stacked for her being such a young age. All other performances were quite lackluster, but that is expected in a film of this nature.
 
 Overall, there is not really much more to say. This film is funny, weird, and wildly fun. It's never going to be a standout competitor for award season but there is something to say about the pure entertainment it was able to deliver.

 ""M3GAN doesn't reinvent the respective subgenre of killer robots or AI that turns against humans, but it kept me entertainingly invested throughout its entire runtime.
 
 Akela Cooper's premise is pushed to its limits - and even beyond - being elevated by excellent performances, a clever satirical narrative, eyebrow-raising killings, and meaningful messages about parenting and technology's role in a child's upbringing.

 I was conflicted before seeing the movie. On the one hand, the trailer looked ridiculous. On the other, I knew that Blumhouse and James Wan partnered for this. After seeing the reviews, I finally accepted that I had to see this movie, and I’m glad I did. Was it ridiculous? Absolutely. M3GAN knew what it was. It knew it was cheesy but had fun with it while also cranking up the tension and suspense. So many cliche “stop standing there and do something” moments that surprisingly added to the stress and horror. I wouldn’t say the movie was ever scary, but it was an excellent thriller. It’s a fun Blumhouse film that was self-aware and goofy while creepy and tense.

It does fire a warning shot to parents who could become over-reliant on their children's own reliance on surrogate friendships and dependencies, but once that point is made - and reiterated - the rest of this is, frankly, all rather unremarkable.",6.0
536554,6471bdc6a199a600a755ec3a,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**It's an enjoyable film, it carries a pertinent anti-tech message, but it's not even close to being a horror film.**
 
 First, let me make one thing clear: horror movies have an imperative duty to scare and disturb us. Tension, suspense, fear and some scares are something that should not be missing. It's the essence of horror cinema, right? So, can someone explain to me where came from the bad idea of making horror movies for teenagers who aren't old enough to ride a motorcycle? Don't get me wrong… the movie is good, and I liked it, but I can't consider it a horror movie. It is not able to frighten anyone! It has no scares (we are able to predict them from a mile!), it has no tension or suspense. As a horror movie, forget it. As the people say, it rains, but it doesn't get us wet, do you understand?
 
 The script begins with a young girl who loses her parents in a tragic accident and goes to live with an aunt who works in a large corporation of highly technological toys. Things aren't easy and neither of them is prepared for the situation. It is in this context that we met M3GAN, a prototype of a toy that is, basically, an android child that is capable of learning, improving itself, teaching and, basically, replacing parents in the tiring task of… being parents. The problem is that, being a machine, it has no notion of good or bad, right or wrong, and that seems to have been a secondary detail in its programming. So it's no surprise that she quickly turns into a sly, cynical creature who kills without any remorse.
 
 The film was directed by Gerard Johnstone, an illustrious unknown. Who is behind the project is the producer and screenwriter James Wan, who we know from “Saw” and “Conjuring 2”. Wan's brand is everywhere. It would have been better if he had directed it and the project had evolved into a somber film, a true horror piece. Allison Williams does the main character well, giving us yet another excellent job. The actress is living a happy moment in her professional life after having shone in “Get Out” and seems to be managing to take advantage of the opportunities. Amie Donald and Jenna Davis, in turn, give body and voice (respectively) to M3GAN, complementing the work with an animatronic doll created for this purpose.
 
 The animatronic doll is nothing new. Cinema has used this technology for decades, and Spielberg's shark – one of the first and most infamous examples – is proof of that. However, the special effects and CGI are to be congratulated. The film utilizes a number of expensive visual and digital resources to excellent effect, wonderfully complementing what was done in the studio. The sound (particularly the sound effects related to the doll) also deserves praise, and the cinematography, even though it doesn't bring new or innovative features, makes the best use of it all. The film has good costumes and convincing sets, as well as a very good, modern and fun soundtrack. It's on the editing table that things go wrong: either because of the excessive length, or because it wants to target young age groups, the film was badly edited, and the cuts are rough. There are even scenes from the trailer that, because they are not in the final cut, make it difficult to understand the story: for example, the scene where Gemma orders M3EGAN to protect Cady, which appears in the trailer and was cut from the film, but which would help to understand why the doll starts to behave that way to protect its young owner.
 
 The only real fear that this film conveys is the credible possibility that, in the medium term, there will be some toy similar to M3GAN. Advances in AI, computing, robot creation and design, or other technologies make it plausible. Will it be that one day we will have robots and androids that, due to their characteristics, will be considered alive and, as such, immortal and, therefore, superior to the humans who created them? I don't think anyone wants to see that. Therefore, the film carries with it a message of distrust in technology, visible not only in M3GAN, but also in Cady's technological dependence. I can do nothing but applaud: the generations born after the year 2000 saw their childhood dominated by cell phones, iPads or computers, to the point of despising conventional games and toys and alienating themselves from living together, normal and healthy, with other children. I'm not making it up, this is a fact that we can all see in a short trip to any school. And if there are parents who appreciate the creation of devices that keep their children busy, I am in the group of parents who see technology as something that should be dosed in a more measured way, allowing children a normal childhood before introducing them to the digital and tech world. I think there is a time for everything in life, and childhood shouldn't be spent looking at screens and LCDs.",7.0

536554,67a8332ade283c900ec8c575,r96sk,"<em>'M3GAN'</em> works for one reason and one reason only: the robot. I could honestly do without the entirety of the scenes that are predominantly about the adults, but the <i>Model 3 Generative Android</i> is, surprisingly, highly entertaining to watch.
 
 The look is good, the effects are very convincing and, unexpectedly, the dialogue really adds to the character; it is lively and amusing, which can't always be said in this genre. They could've perhaps made the robot more unsettling, though it is minorly creepy once or twice.
 
 Allison Williams, despite my lack of overt interest in the older folk, is solid in a prominent role. She looks like Amanda Peet to me in this, I even had to check it wasn't Peet; even though I knew the years/ages totally didn't work. Violet McGraw is decent. Less said about Ronny Chieng, the better.
 
 The only thing I knew about this before watching was the dance, which isn't featured as much as I was anticipating based on how much I saw it referenced when the film came out. On similar-ish note, I enjoyed the uses of ""Titanium"" and ""Toy Soldiers"" in this.

536554,67c9e2cc2e7291306f24cab7,RalphRahal,"M3GAN is a fun mix of sci-fi, horror, and satire, playing on our growing fascination (and fear) of AI. The plot is simple but effective, following a tech-driven story that doesn’t waste much time on deep explanations. Instead, it throws us straight into the chaos of a hyper-intelligent AI doll bonding with a child in ways that quickly spiral out of control. While the movie touches on interesting themes about technology and parenting, it doesn't go too deep into the mechanics of M3GAN’s creation, which leaves some questions unanswered. That being said, it still delivers an engaging and entertaining ride.
 
 The directing keeps things moving at a steady pace, balancing horror and humor well. The cinematography is solid, with some nice shots that make M3GAN feel eerily lifelike. The use of lighting and framing helps create an unsettling atmosphere, especially when the doll is in focus. The acting is a mixed bag, while the young girl and the actress behind M3GAN absolutely carry the film, some of the supporting performances feel flat. There are moments where certain characters feel like they’re reading off a script rather than delivering natural dialogue, which can take you out of the moment.
 
 The script is decent, with some sharp moments of humor and tension, but it could have used a bit more depth in certain areas, especially around M3GAN’s development and motivations. The sound design and score work well in building suspense, adding to the film’s creepy but playful tone. Overall, M3GAN is a fun watch, especially if you enjoy AI-themed horror with a touch of dark humor. It may not be groundbreaking, but it knows exactly what it is and plays to its strengths.",7.0

 I can't overlook that poster, how amateur can you get - it genuinely looks like something I'd whip up seconds before the deadline. Thankfully, the movie itself is very good, it's one I enjoyed quite a bit. The animation is class, the lions look amazingly majestic. I will say the white ones look a bit iffy, but that's nothing even close to a big issue.
 
 The voice cast are all perfectly good. Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (only now realising his character wasn't called Tucker... bit embarrassing on my part), John Kani et al. all merit props. The standouts for me, however, are Mads Mikkelsen and Lennie James - two actors I do love watching (or listening to, in this case), admittedly.
 
 Music-wise, it's not the strongest - I can't recall any of the songs, to be honest. That's not actually a terrible thing though, as it means none of the musical numbers grated on me either - and that's always a win in my books. Elsewhere, Timon & Pumbaa are unamusing and wasted, but at the same time are unnecessarily forced into this prequel/sequel.
 
 Obviously, this still falls far adrift of the beloved original animated film. Nevertheless, I'll hold it in higher esteem than the 2019 remake, even if I didn't overly mind that one to be fair. Oh, lastly, nice touch dedicating this to James Earl Jones at the get-go - was expecting it at the end.",8.0

The pair prove inseparable as they grow up, but the encroachment of a pride of angry white lions led by ""Kiros"" soon threatens their peaceful lives and forces the two to flee in search of a mystical land.

Not that jeopardy is in anyway the point here, it's not that kind of Disney film. It's really just a fairly shameless rip-off of the first, far superior, film that though it looks great with all the integrated live-action visuals has a story that's cheesily wafer thin. It's purpose is to set out the origins of the ""Lion King"" (1994) but all it really does is remind us of just how good that was and just how average this one is. They keep referring to the ""Circle of Life"" but barring a few meanderings from the orchestral score into the songs from the past, we are simply left with some banal offerings from Lin-Manuel Miranda best summed up by ""Bye Bye"" - straight from the Janet and John book of rhyming ""seas"" with ""trees"". Certainly, it looks great but it's also quite confusing whom it's for. The kids watching in the cinema with me were quickly bored by the undercooked story once the awe of the visuals had worn off.

It’s during one such visit that he confides to his sister “Rose” (Mathilde Courcol-Rozés) that he needs a bone-marrow transplant. She readily agrees to help out but when she is found to be incompatible, that news opens quite a can of worms that results in him having to ask “Jimmy” (Pierre Lottin) - a brother he didn’t know he had and who lives in a quietly dying town where his workplace is earmarked for closure, to help out. Initially uninterested and disbelieving, the film now illustrates just how the two men come to terms with their past, their present and (hopefully) their future against a backdrop of resentment and privilege as they try to reconcile with the elements of “luck of the draw” that have governed their lives thus far. Fortunately, they have one thing in common. They both love music, and as it transpires that “Jimmy” plays trombone in his local mineworkers band we have a conduit for them to bond - or not! There are shades of “Brassed Off” (1996) as this offers us a social commentary on the decline of traditional rural industries that leave little by way of hope or opportunity in it’s wake; a little bit of romance and some seriously horrible uniforms too! Along the way, there is also some fine classical Mozart, some crooning from Charles Aznavour and some enjoyable band rehearsals with an eclectic collection of the townsfolk proving remarkably talented with instrument and voice alike - after a soupçon of guidance. No, there probably isn’t so much jeopardy about the denouement, though there is a twist - it’s really a story about family and one that’s presented without too much sentiment and a bit of enjoyably bloody-minded Gallic humour.

He likes to speak his own language “Elioese” and is fascinated, obsessed even, with making contact with alien life. He’s convinced that there is intelligent life out there, so imagine his surprise when he hears of a possible response from the Voyager mission sent decades ago. Next thing, well he is transported to the kaleidoscopic “communiverse” where everyone share peace, knowledge and friendship. Well, nearly everyone. The nasty “Grigon” wants to join but when they politely decline he threatens them with obliteration - and a verifiable obliteration at that. Clever these folks may be, but fighters they are not so it falls to “Elio” to prove his worth by trying to negotiate some sort of truce! Off to the big warship he goes, and that’s where he meets “Glordon” and learns a great deal more about his potential foe, and about friendship and loyalty as they embark on some lively escapades. Now there’s not a great deal here that could ever be called original. It’s got plenty of themes and tech rehashed from films gone by, but it’s still an enjoyable and fun tale with a message that resonates engagingly. It challenges stereotypes on just about everything from machismo bullying to parenting and cuddling and though the visuals are up to their usual high standard, fluid, imaginative and colourful, they don’t overwhelm the simplicity of the thrust which is a story about trust friendship.

1022787,685bf9c68753d79cfce4301a,Manuel São Bento,"Elio is a heartwarming, intergalactic adventure that once again proves Pixar's mastery in crafting family-friendly stories layered with deeper emotional undercurrents. The voice cast is impeccable, with every performance radiating charm and sincerity, making it easy for viewers of all ages to connect with these vibrant characters. The score, as is typical for the studio, plays a pivotal role in guiding the emotional journey, gently elevating moments of wonder, sadness, and joy without ever feeling overbearing. There's an infectious sense of fun throughout, with plenty of space-faring antics to keep kids engaged, while older audiences will find value in the themes of loneliness, grief, and the universal desire for belonging.
 
 However, Elio doesn't reach the emotional or narrative heights of Pixar's most iconic offerings. Its message, while undoubtedly impactful and accessible, feels too broadly framed to leave a lasting personal mark. The themes are universally relatable, but the movie's refusal to dig deeper into its more profound ideas keeps it from resonating on a soul-piercing level. It's touching, yes, but in a way that feels like a gentle nod rather than a heartfelt embrace. Still, Elio remains a commendable addition to Pixar's filmography - emotionally rich, charmingly performed, and filled with enough heartfelt moments to justify the trip across the stars.

1022787,68673c87604711a2f77b79b6,Chris Sawin,"Elio (Yonas Kibreab) is an 11-year-old boy who has recently lost his parents. He’s been taken in by his aunt Olga (Zoe Saldana). Olga works in orbital analysis and is gone a lot. Feeling like he doesn’t belong anywhere and nobody wants him, Elio finds comfort in interplanetary life. He takes on an obsession with ham radios and attempts to communicate with aliens while simultaneously trying to get abducted nightly.
 
 One night, Elio is finally abducted by aliens. He’s introduced to an incredible new environment with alien species the likes of which the human eye has never seen or interacted with. He wants to stay forever until they reveal that they think he’s the leader of Earth. Elio lies his way into the alien community, but to stay he must risk his life to save them.
 
 There are themes in Elio that are circled back around in elegant fashion. Elio loses his family before the film even begins. He’s also weird enough that he doesn’t have any friends. The film tries to paint Elio in a creative light like he has this big imagination because he’s invented his own language and can lie himself into and out of any situation. But he mostly comes off as a shitty person that treats his hard-working aunt, who only wants to support him and for him to love her, like dirt.
 
 The animated sci-fi adventure film is about Elio coming to terms with the loss of his parents. He feels alone, has low self-esteem, and has extreme acceptance issues. But the film explores what it’s like to find your own family made of new friends and that you’re never really as low or alone as you think you are.
 
 He is initially shipped off to boarding school because of his uncontrollable behavior and inability to not be a destructive shit. Once he’s at the Communiverse, he meets a liquid-like supercomputer named OOOOO. She clones Elio and sends his clone back to Earth so no one will notice that he’s gone. But as Elio checks up on him, he sees what it’s like to be a family with his aunt and becomes homesick.
 
 Visually, the film is at its best when Elio is at the Communiverse. The Communiverse is filled with all sorts of alien leaders from all over the galaxy with the intent of sharing their knowledge with others and hopefully recruiting other respectable leaders. These sequences are filled with all sorts of eccentric creatures while its “alien” explanation allows things like basic physics or logic to be thrown out the window.
 
 Hands down the best character and most enjoyable part of the film is Glordon. He is worm-like and his design was inspired by larval insects and microbiotic creatures like the tardigrade. His mouth seems to go on forever and is overrun with teeth kind of like a Dune sandworm. He can spin web like a spider and is heat and lava-resistant. He looks menacing and scary, but once he gets an English translator has an adorable little kid’s voice and is super expressive even though he doesn’t have any eyes. The friendship he develops with Elio has way more of an impact than the one the film forces him into with his aunt.
 
 Unfortunately, Elio crawls at a slug-like pace through what feels like the longest hour and a half of the summer. It struggles through its first hour as Elio lies to everyone around him, gets in way over his head with the aliens, and attempts to abandon his aunt forever. Elio’s big plan is to join the alien community and leave Earth with no intention of ever going back. But apart from the enjoyable montage of Elio showing Glordon the Communiverse, the entire movie is just “Oh no, I lied too hard and don’t know what to do now.”
 
 Animated films and TV shows have used slow-motion before, but Elio has some of the worst slow-motion effects in the history of animation. The slow-mo here looks like it was a decision that was made in post-production as the effect doesn’t look to be part of the animation but the editing of the film itself. It’s done in a way that makes you think the projector is acting up or something. It’s so jittery and awkward looking and the intended effect is probably not whatever you see on screen.
 
 Elio is visually fun to look at and it gets somewhat entertaining in its last 20 minutes or so, but is otherwise a big, disappointing bowl of intergalactic garbage. The film chooses to follow an unlikeable character who is a brat the entire time and the main takeaway is that he shouldn’t be so much of a shithead and be decent to those who actually care about him for some reason. There’s something fun and whimsical here trapped inside the body of an entitled, lie-spewing thundercunt.",2.0

Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a ""better"" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.
 
 The film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic ""fourth act"" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.

933260,66f78cdb271200492ecbf65d,Brent Marchant,"There’s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film’s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that’s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members’ patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn’t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering “Titane” (2021). It also shamelessly “borrows” elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from “The Shining” (1980) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), costume designs from the “Hunger Games” franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like “Vertigo” (1958). Then there’s the picture’s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture’s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how “The Substance” captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I’m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than “substance.”",4.0

Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best ""Jekyll and Hyde"" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen.

With the gushing ""Harvey"" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised ""Elisabeth"" - but shat can she do? There's no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it's all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David's - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there's little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives. A savage indictment of the short-term and unprincipled ""beauty"" industry that aims squarely at just about everyone and everything involved, is engagingly toxic and well worth a watch.",7.0

 <em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!
 
 I think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.
 
 The story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.
 
 Demi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!

 While on the face, this movie is about aging out of Hollywood's graces, the script is also laced with interesting subplots: having a proxy that ages for you a la Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, and the subject of shallow self-hate and self-love, along with that ""needy for applause"" character that so many actors have and must either learn to deal, or fail at life.
 
 Demi Moore is nothing short of awesome here. Dennis Quaid and Margaret Qualley are right up there with her and Fargeat in playing over-the-top choices.",9.0

 A Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time
 
 ""The Substance"" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society's obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.
 The film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.
 At its core, ""The Substance"" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a 'sexy reality' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.
 The narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death—being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore's character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.
 
 **Practical Effects and Gore**
 From the opening scenes, it's evident that the physical effects are a labor of love—a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg's ""The Fly,"" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.
 
 **Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**
 The color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.
 
 **Performances**
 Demi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film's themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society's views on youth and aging.
 
 **Critique**
 While the film excels in many areas, it isn't without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.
 
 **Engaging with the Hype**
 ""The Substance"" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it's worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.
 
 
 ""The Substance"" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like ""Gremlins,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" and ""Carrie,"" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.
 Despite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation—a hallmark of impactful cinema. It's as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, ""The Substance"" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society's own fears and obsessions.
 
 **Extra Thoughts**
 - The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?
 - The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.
 - The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today's youth-centric culture.
 
 **Final Recommendation**
 ""The Substance"" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you're a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.",9.0
933260,67515679516edeab299925d8,MovieGuys,"""The Substance"" is something of a cinematic mash up. 
 
 First off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of ""Death Becomes Her"". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. 
 
 The notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.
 
 That said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90's counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I'd typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. 
 
 This work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to a compelling narrative based experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.
 
 My only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. 
 
 In summary, ""The Substance"" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. 
 
 I will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.",7.0

 The film focuses too heavily on the body of Margaret Qualley's character, Sue, at the expense of delivering a meaningful story or message. The gratuitous gore towards the end seems to be an attempt to align with current trends, but it falls flat.

 However, while it’s bold and at times deeply unsettling, it doesn’t quite achieve that elusive ""perfectly balanced (as all things should be, cit.)"" quality.
 The narrative occasionally stumbles, with gaps that detract from its overall impact.
 It’s thought-provoking but not groundbreaking — a film that’s above average, yet just shy of excellence.

 Harry Potter is an Orphan who on his eleventh birthday discovers he's a wizard and is called to term at Hogwarts School. But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.
 
 Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.
 
 Director Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.
 
 The characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious ""who done it"" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.
 
 Owls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10",8.0
671,61117b67344a8e005e2c2056,Venti_Pro,"Alright first lets start with my problems with this movie.
 Some of the effects do not hold up and that can take away from the magic or suspense.
 The child actors are not very good at acting in this movie.
  It is way to easy to nitpick this movie and all the nitpicks can be very distracting.
 I think the main theme was used way to much in the beginning and that kind of took the magic out of the main theme for me.
 I personally did not get sucked into this world which made me kind of bored at times.
 People love the harry potter movies but these movies don't really click with me when it comes to characters, the lore, and the magic and I think the full story of harry potter is to drawn out and I just want the movies to get to the point.
 For me if the ending of the film is not very satisfying my respect for the movie drops a ton and I don't think the ending of this movie was very satisfying!
 The villain in this movie is super basic.
 Now on to the good stuff!
 I like how most of the scenes build up the characters, show us some magic, and it builds up the mystery!
 I like the sets and costumes a lot!
 I like most of the music!",
671,638132c86e938a00a0ebcd36,Nathan,"_Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone_ is a masterclass is world building. This movie's world breathes and slowly discovering every inch of it is a joy, from Diagon Alley to Hogwarts Castle.
 
 I would not say the story is overly brilliant, but that is just a catalyst for the world in this first film. Despite its minor drawbacks, it does enough to intrigue the viewer and kept me engaged.
 
 The performances are a little off, which is expected as this film is primarily carried by three twelve-year-olds. But they get better as the film progresses and the adults in the film are able to bring the average up with their amazing performances.
 
 Overall, this movie suffers from being dated with poor effects, CGI, and some rough child acting. Never-the-less, it manages to create an experience like no other and I expect the films to do nothing but improve from the initial entry.

That she worked closely with Chris Columbus in the creation of this adaptation of her introductory story featuring the boy-wizard means it stays broadly faithful to the book but allows the imagery to replace, rather than duplicate, the narrative. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson validate the best in the casting director's art as we set off on this wonderfully enjoyable fantasy adventure. The supporting cast - Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Zoë Wanamaker et al all add richness to this as young ""Mr. Potter"" and is friends begin to realise their magical potential. John Williams works his wonders creating a score almost as recognisable as his ""Star Wars"" theme and the special effects are gentle, yet sophisticated. It is a bit on the lengthy side, and some of the adaptation sacrifices a little of the humour from the book - but all in all a movie to stand the tests of time.",7.0

 Also, it is difficult to support this movie, considering that Tyler Perry, the director, has a notorious reputation of sexually assaulting and harassing young men in Hollywood.

 My new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;
 
 1. The Avengers
 2. Iron Man
 3. Thor
 4. Captain America
 5. Iron Man 2
 6. The Incredible Hulk
 
 I had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us… So worth it.
 
 I think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. 
 
 In terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau’s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I’ve ever seen.
 
 The only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor’s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn’t a Thor movie, so we don’t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year’s Thor 2, it is very possible we’ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki’s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won’t spoil it by telling you who they’re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn’t really drive the story at all.
 
 I feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.
 
 The Avengers doesn’t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn’t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!

 The special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some “depth” to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.
 
 I’ve always liked Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he’s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the “puny god” scene (if you haven’t seen the film yet you’ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).
 
 I have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I’m Scandinavian so…
 
 Anyway, this was a great film. I enjoyed it very much.",

 The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.
 
 Asgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.
 
 I have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.
 
 I wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.
 
 Flaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012?

 And though it’s action isn’t quite as entertaining as its predecessors and it’s unfortunate to see Awkwafina playing yet another thief (_Jumanji: The Next Level_ says hello), for the most part, _Kung Fu Panda 4_ happily skadooshes its way to animated greatness.

With ""Po"" being told by ""Master Shifu"" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the ""Chameleon"" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. ""Po"" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend ""Zhen"" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the ""Furious Five"". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.",6.0

 Even after more than 10 years, I still miss the first Kung Fu Panda movie as it was genuinely a masterpiece. The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.
 
 This movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. 
 
 Pathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.
 
 Just like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to ""Mary Sue"" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.
 
 I am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won’t be watching any more trash from this franchise.
 
 If you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.

 Dialog writers need to remove certain words from their joke book, like ""method"", as in method acting. When I hear method acting, I think Jared Leto. Associating Jared Leto's ""method acting"" with your movie probably isn't a good thing. Method acting and Jared Leto occupied real estate rent free for the entirety of this movie. It didn't help that they couldn't stop themselves from thinking ""it's so nice, we'll say it twice"".

I had to watch a recap of the previous entries, naturally, and didn't remember much, aside from the cast and main characters.
 
 I reckon I'll be saying the exact same thing in X amount of months about this one, that doesn't necessarily mean a film is bad though - because this release isn't. The voices we hear are perfectly satisfactory, from Jack Black to Awkwafina, Viola Davis (the best, away from lead) and the rest.
 
 The music here is good. There is one piece of the score, which is heard a couple of times and during the end credits, that must be a homage of sorts to television show <em>'Dexter'</em> - weird connection granted, but it sounds practically exactly the same to me.
 
 On the note of the sound, I enjoyed Tenacious D's rock cover of ""...Baby One More Time"". I listened to it an embarrassing amount when it first released alongside this movie, the video was admittedly part of the reason why - I'm always a fan of seeing film casts in music videos.

But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we’re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong’o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn’t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don’t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she’s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she’s charged with raising when the gosling’s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture’s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong’o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O’Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What’s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it’s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. “The Wild Robot” is one of those films that’s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren’t particularly enamored with animation. It’s a feel-good movie that doesn’t resort to wearing that trait on its sleeve – but that nevertheless achieves such an admirably heartwarming effect anyways.",7.0

 Of course, animation has “heroed” nature before – see The Lion King, WALL-E and basically the entire output of Studio Ghibli. But there’s two core elements to The Wild Robot that set this film apart from the rest. The first is its gorgeous, painterly style.
 
 The second? The film’s deeply human themes, encompassing everything from the meaning of motherhood and the lasting legacy of adoption, to our worship of technological advancement and our fraught relationship with the natural world. Like we said – The Wild Robot is nothing if not surprising.

Whatever it is that needs doing, it is there to make it happen - even when it is wrecked on an island populated by animals whose main desire in life is to eat each other. At least the arrival of the ""monster"" manages to galvanise them into one brief moment of hostile unanimity and so when they are not trying to cannibalise it, they are shunning it's efforts to be friends. After spending a year learning their various languages, there follows a calamitous escapade with a nest, a chase with an hungry fox (""Fink"") and the creation of the most unlikely of family units charged with rearing a particularly timid little gosling whom they name ""Brightbill"". The scene is now set for some entertaining adventures as ""Roz"" has to teach her new-found charge how to eat, to swim and then ultimately to fly away so as to avoid the harsh winter. Each of those tasks comes with it's own hazards but maybe, just maybe, our little team can manage to get project ""Brightbill"" off the ground? No, of course there's no jeopardy here at all, and at times it's comes across as an amalgam of ""Wall:E"" (2008) with some Hans Christian Anderson thrown in for good measure. That's no bad thing, though, as the characterisation of the android is personable and develops amiably as his programming starts to evolve into something far more akin to a soul than a brain. It does tackle some more serious subjects - loneliness, rejection, isolation and issues with self-esteem to name a few, but always in fashion that illustrates a point then offers some sort of optimism that a solution can be found for even the most difficult challenges. The standard of animation is engagingly natural and it's genuinely quite funny with some of the observations, especially from the fox, working well within the framework of a touching story that extols the values of caring, teamwork and even a little forgiveness, without becoming gloopy or dialogue-heavy.

 ""The Wild Robot offers much more than just immersive visuals, inspirational music, and diverse moments of pure entertainment - it's a deeply reflective story that tackles complex, relevant themes with a delicate balance of heart and humor. Through the robotic protagonist's journey of self-discovery, Chris Sanders explores the intersection of technology and nature, touching on topics like identity, empathy, and community, among others.
 
 This thematic depth, combined with astonishing animation and an exceptional voice cast, makes Roz's adventure not only one of the most remarkable movies of the year but also an impactful study of coexistence, adaptation, and what it truly means to live in harmony with the world around us.""

 Without a doubt, this is one of the finest animated movies in years. DreamWorks has delivered a masterpiece that resonates deeply. It's impossible not to empathize with the story and characters as they unfold so brilliantly on screen. Prepare yourself for an emotional journey that hits like a ton of bricks.
 
 The attention to detail is remarkable. I was particularly impressed by the animation style, especially the distinct visual approach tailored to some characters. This creative choice truly makes them shine and adds depth to the storytelling.

Thanks to the sacred lotus, there’s a bit of reincarnation going on, but will that be completed in time to save the population of the “Chentang Pass” about to be attacked by an army of lava-borne devils? With certain defeat looming, the immortals start to take an hand in things - not unlike the story of the siege of Troy, and just like that take from antiquity, there is plenty of betrayal and duplicity to complement the more traditional stories of loyalty, family and team building as the story gradually builds to it’s pot-boiling climax. The CGI is better than many, much less two-dimensional, and there is lots of vibrant action as the naive but honourable young “Nezha” must find his own destiny, define his relationship with the more clean cut “Ao Bing” all despite the distant intervention of the “Loong” dragon kings and always under the watchful gaze of the cloud-hopping “Wu Liang” - a being outwardly benign and munificent, but is he all that he seems behind that grey beard? If you are of a mind to look deeper, then it may well offer up a critique of modern China - or, quite possibly many other societies, where the weak are manipulated and persecuted, where family is increasingly undervalued and where power and riches are the true gods. Essentially, I just found it to be a classily produced computer animation that mixed the astonishing richness of Chinese mythology with a solid adventure concept and just a little bit of pantomime humour as we go along. It looks great in a cinema, and doesn’t hang about getting off to a lively start  and pacing well for a couple of action-packed hours.",7.0
324544,67dacee6c536af65bba6d248,CinemaSerf,"With mankind reduced to living amidst a god-fearing zealousness in a city under a mountain where they are ruled by a decrepit overlord and his much younger queen (Amara Okereke), it would appear that their only hope of salvation from that salvation rests with the witch “Gray Alys” (Milla Jovovich). If she can make direct eye contact with you, then she can manipulate what you think and see. She has only narrowly escaped the “Enforcer” (Arly Jover) when she receives a couple of visitors who ask her for a favour. She cannot decline their request so long as they pay, and so must accept their challenge to obtain a shape-shifting wolf for them. The only place that this could be found is in the lawless “Lost Lands” and for that she needs the help of the legendary hunter “Boyce” (Dave Bautista). He hasn’t his troubles to seek either, but after a bit of mutual rescuing, they ally and set off on their quest. Of course, the “Enforcer” is in hot pursuit on an heavily armoured train and so with volcanoes, demons and her crusading troops on their tails it’s not easy task to stay alive in the first place let alone track and catch their quarry. By about half an hour in, we have plundered just about everything from “Indiana Jones” via “Lord of the Rings” (I’m sure I saw “Treebeard here”); “Underworld”, “Harry Potter and the” (take your pick) and, of course, “Mad Max” as this derivative dystopian story lumbers along in an entirely predictable fashion. There’s not the slightest hint of chemistry between the two stars at the top of the billing and what jeopardy there is comes straight from the CGI folks who do, admittedly, manage to create quite an imaginatively crafted world of dilapidated human civilisation to compensate for the writer’s rather mundanely crafted one of human collapse. It’s not remotely scary and the combat scenes are repetitive; the scheming and plotting with Okereke and her eye-candy henchboy “Jerais” (Simon Lööf) are lacklustre and the conclusion leaves virtually nothing to the imagination, even in the dark!

With the Manchu court facing the great powers we saw in ""55 Days at Peking"" (1963) the Empress Dowager dispatches her finest officer to San Francisco to track down a traitor. As it happens, the Holmesian ""Fu"" (Haoran Liu) is also in that very city on a quest for the killer of the daughter of senator ""Grant"" (John Cusack). Quite swiftly his investigation and the imperial mission start to overlap as the enthusiastic ""Fu"" and his newfound spiritual Indian guide ""Gui"" (Baoqiang Wang) discover that the prime suspect in the killing (Steven Zhang) is the son of local entrepreneur ""Bai"" (Chow Yun-Fat) and that the senator is using this to stir anti-Chinese sentiment to the point where he can force them out and seize their property. What now ensues delivers a series of rather randomly assembled escapades that mix murder mystery with western with romance and add a good dose of skullduggery to boot as they try to prove the young ""Bai"" was framed. Fu and Wang make for a decent enough double act at times, but the story loses it's way way too often and after a while the characterisations - especially ""Bai"" and ""Grant"" become light-weight and strained parodies. Fortunately, after about two hours, auteur Sicheng Chen must have felt he was running out of file space and so decided he'd better wrap things up - and for that last quarter of an hour the story knits together things we knew with things we didn't and presents us with a rather feeble denouement that did sort of suggest that there could be more adventures to come for the likeable ""Gui"" and ""Fu"". What is potent is the closing statement from the elder ""Bai"" about remembering the importance of immigrant labour in establishing a country that was all too quick to shun that working community later when it suited it, but it's made in a cack-handed and over-the-top fashion and drowned out by an overpowering score and thus loses much of an impact that might actually resonate in an USA that's still unsure how to recognise those who do/did the work but perhaps didn't all have the same/right skin colour or paperwork.

 ""Venom"" is the rare exception to this rule. For starters there's Tom Hardy, who is, by any measure, an excellent actor. Secondly, there's the interplay between Hardy and Venom which can be genuinely funny. 
 
 This latest and possibly last film in the series, ""Venom: The Last Dance"", is, I believe, the weakest in the line up. Unlike its predecessors, it feels a little bit rushed and somehow, anti climatic. That said, it still has its moments of engaging humour and not half decent action.
 
 In summary, its a shame to see ""Venom"" shelved (if in fact that's the case) as its one of the better Marvel universe franchises, with great chemistry between Hardy and his other worldly alter ego, Venom. Worth a look if you enjoyed the other films.",6.0
912649,676d29688258294bb8613d5c,watchnrant,"Okay, here’s the deal with _Venom: The Last Dance_. It’s like ordering your favorite burger and realizing halfway through they forgot the sauce. Tom Hardy? Still killing it as Eddie and Venom—his back-and-forth with himself is weirdly entertaining and even a little emotional. There are some genuinely fun and heartfelt moments that remind you why this duo worked in the first place.
 
 But man, the rest? A hot mess. The plot is all over the map, the new characters are forgettable, and the villain? Weak sauce. It feels like the filmmakers just kind of shrugged and said, “Eh, good enough.” Sure, there are flashes of that buddy-comedy charm, but not enough to save the movie from feeling like it’s limping to the finish line.
 
 If this is the final Venom movie (and I hope it is), I’m not gonna cry about it. It’s a mixed bag—fun in bits, but overall, it’s like Venom himself: a bit too sloppy to fully love.",

 ""Gladiator II may not achieve the groundbreaking impact of the original film, but it remains an impressive cinematic experience, transporting audiences into an epic filled with emotional and visual grandeur.
 
 Ridley Scott once again showcases his mastery in blending narrative, action, and thematic depth, delivering a sequel marked by superb technical execution and standout performances, particularly from Denzel Washington. Despite the inevitable comparisons to the classic, the iconic filmmaker presents a story that justifies its existence, even if it treads familiar ground.
 
 Necessary or not, what truly matters is the strength (and honor) with which a work captivates us - and here, Gladiator II triumphs.""

558449,67372614c62c3a26ad055ce3,griggs79,"_Gladiator II_, a polished echo of the original, is a testament to Ridley Scott's cinematic powers. It follows his hit-and-miss _Napoleon_ biopic last year, which was rather miss than hit. The sequel captures the original's essence while introducing elements, making it a worthy successor.
 
 Paul Mescal in the lead role - inherited from the ever-growling Russel Crowe, who was at the top of his career in the original - holds his ground against Denzel Washington, whose charisma cleaves through the screen as effortlessly as his character's sword.
 
 Ridley Scott admits he was prompted to revisit _Gladiator_ by the acclaim he received from those too young to have seen the original on the big screen. His mission to lure Gen Z away from their streaming devices may help to save cinema, ushering in a new era of appreciation for the big screen. But for the love of Jupiter, I hope they quickly learn that it isn't just a big iPad with comfy chairs. No pausing, swiping, mid-film selfies, dashes to the bar, or running commentary required. Screen four at your local cinema isn't the Colosseum but a place where the magic of film of this scale truly comes alive, offering a unique and immersive experience that can't be replicated at home.",8.0
558449,67379dd0ac9f3ba08155924f,r96sk,"<em>'Gladiator II'</em> is awesome!
 
 I only watched the original three years ago, almost to the day in fact, but I was anticipating this follow-up after thoroughly loving the Russell Crowe film. Honestly, I think I kinda enjoyed this sequel more - at worst, the two are on the same level, for me anyway. Crowe is missed, though everyone in this movie more than makes up for his (obvious) absence.
 
 This is the first time I've seen Paul Mescal act, despite knowing of him for quite a while now. I'm impressed! He delivers a showing of great strength (pardon the pun). Pedro Pascal is very good too, as is Joseph Quinn; I wasn't instantly sold on the latter when he appeared onscreen, though when all is said and done I rate his performance positively.
 
 Denzel Washington... what a geezer. I'll never tire or turn down the chance at seeing that man act. Needless to say, given he's one of two favourite actors of mine, I loved his performance all the way through. The likes of Fred Hechinger and Connie Nielsen merit fair praise as well, interesting to see Rory McCann and Matt Lucas in there too.
 
 Oh, and the score... superb! Deafeningly grand.",9.0
558449,6738546ca181a717eac89458,CinemaSerf,"Sixteen years after ""Maximus"" (Russell Crowe) bit the dust, we find ancient Rome under the control of twins ""Geta"" (Joseph Quinn) and his brother ""Caracalla"" (Fred Hechinger) and thanks to their general ""Acacias"" (Pedro Pascal) continuing to expand their empire. It's this latter man who leads an attack on the home ""Nanno"" (Paul Mescal) shares with his wife ""Arishat"" (Yuval Gonen). That doesn't go so well and next thing, she's gone on ahead of him to the wheat fields and he's now a slave owned by the manipulative ""Macrinus"" (Denzel Washington) heading to the Colosseum to entertain the emperors and their cousin ""Lucilla"" (Connie Nielsen). What now ensues is a well produced and good looking rehash of the first film paying homage en route to ""Spartacus"" and it's the sheer predicability that I struggled with. It's episodically delivered with far too much script and though Mescal tries hard, his performance is largely charm-free and as wooden as a rudius, especially once the rather far-fetched familial back-story has been established. Sir Derek Jacobi sparingly appears as the other survivor from 2000 reprising his role as the senator ""Gracchus"" but to no real effect and the scene stealer for me is really only the megalomanic Quinn's imperial offering as he and his bonkers sibling teeter on the brink of inbred, sexually fluid, madness. Washington does well enough as the scheming slave-master, but he hasn't really enough to work with to stand out amongst what really are a mediocre collection of undercooked characters that just don't deliver any real sense of the hedonism and menace of this debauched and corrupt state. As with Sir Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) the battle scenes are superb and action packed, as are the combat scenes in the vast marble auditorium filled with baying plebs and rhinos, but I am afraid that the shallow characterisations just didn't work well enough to keep this engaging and the plot was just too thin to stretch over a couple of hours that could have been so very much better. It really does need a big screen to appreciate the creatively crafted visuals, but I was still pretty disappointed, sorry.",6.0

558449,673d34ed757b2842d9d8a184,Chris Sawin,"Gladiator II features some impressive action sequences. Every battle in the Colosseum is fantastic despite how historically inaccurate they may be. The monkey sequence showcases how skilled Hanno (Paul Mescal) is not only as a fighter but also in how he interacts with others. Then there's the rhino sequence that plays out much like Bugs Bunny’s interactions with Toro the Bull in the Chuck Jones-directed Looney Tunes short Bully for Bugs (1953).
 
 While those sequences are fairly believable, the shark sequence seems like pure fantasy and that’s why it’s so incredible. They fill the Colosseum with water and let sharks loose while the opposing gladiators try to survive the onslaught on boats.
 
 It’s also interesting to note that every major actor who dies in the film has a spectacular death. Not only that but these gruesome deaths get increasingly more grisly and memorable as the film progresses. These bloody triumphs rarely delve any deeper than someone getting shot with a bunch of arrows or a beheading or appendage severing of some kind. This level of brutality escalates throughout the film and eventually culminates with the most satisfying kill that takes two and a half hours to achieve.
 
 The performances fluctuate between being top-tier perfection and mediocre overacting. Denzel Washington is having the time of his life as Macrinus. He has the most interesting storyline and Denzel dances in every scene with a giddiness that is unparalleled. Joseph Quinn seems to be acting in an entirely different film than everyone else as Emperor Geta. His mannerisms are operatic and theatrical with his wide eyes that rarely blink, grand body language and hand gestures, and explosive line delivery.
 
 Pedro Pascal doesn’t do anything in Gladiator II as Marcus Acacius that he didn’t do in Game of Thrones apart from having more screen time. Much like how his character is written, Paul Mescal’s performance is muddled. The Hanno character and who he is is a poorly kept secret that consistently pulls the character in several directions.
 
 Hanno is vengeful at first before succumbing to being the hero of the film and the evolution isn’t earned. The writing and pacing of Gladiator II feel like the film drops Hanno’s fate in his lap halfway through, which he’s either forgotten about over two decades or never knew until the audience did.
 
 Connie Nielsen, one of the few returning actors from the original film, is awful in this. Her acting in Gladiator II always comes off as forced as her crying scenes are often portrayed as constipated grunts with crocodile tears. Her dialogue delivery is also strained and broken despite being given some of the most important sequences of character connections and reawakenings of sorts in the sequel.
 
 Calling Gladiator II action-heavy is misleading because the film drags between every fight sequence. The film is largely dull and difficult to indulge during its quieter moments. The film is gorgeous with its incredible set pieces, intricate costume design, and impressive use of infinitely numerous extras. Director Ridley Scott reunites with all of the set decorators (Sonja Klaus, Crispian Sallis, and Emilio Ardura) and costume designer (Janty Yates) that he worked with on Gladiator in 2000. From a visual standpoint, Ridley Scott's films are highly detailed masterpieces.
 
 Denzel Washington’s extravagant performance makes Gladiator II worthwhile. Still, not even its excessively violent action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and masterful set and costume design can save the sequel from how boring it is. Ridley Scott waited over twenty years to make a sequel that is more than twice as expensive as the original only to rehash the same story points.",5.0

 What is a surprise is that people are giving spoiler alerts.  I don't understand why.  Like so many movie squeals and reboots what you have here is Gladiator with everything intelligent and entertaining sucked out of it.  So it's the same movie, but shorter.  There are two emperors rather than ones.  Rome is falling, but not from the debauchery, intellectual laziness, and over stretched militarism that really caused it's fall... that would be anti-woke to point out it collapsed for all the reasons they love.  Instead some lazy leftism the right is evil crap, peppered with fiery but mostly peaceful protests blamed on the thinly veiled reference to Trump.  Might as well have the baddies wear red hats that read ""Make Rome Great Again.""

 Gladiator lite (II) mimics its predecessor but its predominantly just a bare essentials remake of a superior, original film.

 The first act rushes through familiar territory. A general, born out of combat, loses his family and ends up as a slave. Sound familiar? It’s the same setup as Maximus’s story, minus the emotional weight. And sending Lucilla’s son away to protect him? That’s not just a weak plot point, it spits on everything Maximus and Marcus died for.
 
 The second act brings nothing new to the table. The “twist” is predictable, the plot messy, and the villains uninspired. Commodus worked because he was layered, a mix of insecurity and cruelty. Here, the two emperors are generic placeholders. Even the attempted coup feels like déjà vu, with none of the intensity or buildup that made the first movie iconic.
 
 The third act delivers a visually stunning battle but lacks substance. The final showdown offers nothing fresh, and the death of the antagonist in front of everyone feels like it’s trying to copy the original. The speech about “Maximus and Marcus’s dream”? We’ve heard it before, and it meant more the first time.
 
 What was the point of that last scene? There were so many ways to end this movie with a high note, something meaningful to honor Lucilla or Acacius. Instead, we get a hollow, pointless ending that adds nothing to the story.
 
 Credit where it’s due: the cinematography, CGI, and score are outstanding. Visually, the movie is a masterpiece, with breathtaking scenery and polished editing. The music, while clearly inspired by the original, carries the mood well. But great visuals can’t save a story that refuses to move forward.

 As for the central narrative about Maximus Meridius’ son? Trivial and painfully predictable. The ""legacy revenge"" arc is telegraphed so clearly you could write the script after the first act. No twists, no depth—just a paint-by-numbers retread of the original’s emotional beats.

 The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.
 
 There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.
 
 It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.
 
 Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.
 
 If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",10.0

Every scene feels purposeful, and the script, adapted from Stephen King’s novella, is simply brilliant in how it weaves small moments into a powerful narrative.
 
 One of the most unforgettable parts of the movie is Brooks’ storyline. Watching him leave the world he knew, only to find himself unable to adapt to a society that had progressed beyond his comprehension, is heartbreaking every time.

That moment, along with Red’s own journey, adds a bittersweet layer of realism to the story’s broader themes of freedom and redemption.

 It was a race swap that not a single person complained about. It didn't really change the movie and one of the big reasons why it didn't change the movie was because the movie wasn't about the race swap and owning the fans of the IP like most every other race swap that people complain about and other people call them political buzz words for not loving... presumably while they secretly agree the movie's crap.

 I kind of want to be a dick and say that the reason this movie is so popular is because of Morgan Freeman's narration, I mean, you could give the guy an instruction manual to read and people would love it.
 
 But then it's more than that.  The movie is popular because it's satisfying.  The good guys win, the bad guys lose, it tells a good story in a competent and compelling way.

They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition.

After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".
 
 Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.
 
 Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.
 
 Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?
 
 Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.
 
 Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how “he got his scars?”. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story.

Nolan clearly did not intend for any subtext, yet that is not an excuse, if anything, that makes it worse. He includes these scenes to make the film more dark and edgy, yet there are people, from suppressed countries, who have to live through the hardships of violence from law-enforcers and dictatorship every day, and in his obliviousness, Nolan thinks that using this in a superhero film is a good excuse for self-importance.

155,62cfbc31394a8704ae5c02a3,CinemaSerf,"Heath Ledger is outstanding in this follow up to the 2006 ""Batman Begins"" outing for the caped crusader. His portrayal of the malevolent ""Joker' is confident and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise ""Gotham"" after ""Batman"" (Christian Bale), ""Gordon"" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney ""Dent"" (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The ""Joker"", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous ""Lau"" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins to realise that his childhood sweetheart ""Rachel"" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal) is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety among those who would bring him down. It's over 2½ hours long, but really does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn't ponderous and moody - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler ""Alfred"", always striving to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them (no super-powers!). On balance I think I still preferred the first film, but as sequels go - this takes, and will take, some beating. On a big screen in a packed cinema, it's just a great experience.",7.0

 This is so predictable and so poorly written that it boggles the mind. Yet there is a fan base of what can only be described as neo Nazis. I guess those fans were poor cuckolds who got jilted by too many brunettes at a young age, and they couldn't get over it.
 That's about the entire story here. Oh, the Joker kills anything he sees. Whoopee. And he's invulnerable. And he's a demigod who can only be beaten by another demigod.
 So, we've got traditional mundane Greek heroes and villains here, just like most Hollywood movies.
 Unfortunately, the fans of these traditional Hollywood movies are the loudest people on Earth, and the biggest control freaks. It's ridiculous to believe there are actually this big a percentage of fans for this kind of depressing Hollywood formula movie making, but if you look at Imdb's top 250, you see such movies make up over half of the top 250. Are they voted up because control freaks vote more than non control freaks? Or are they voted up because control freaks use many fake user names? Probably both, which explains why over half of the top 250 are nothing more than Greek traditional idolizations of control freaks.
 Oh, and Batman turns totally gay, which would be okay if he'd admit it, but he's given the choice of saving a man from death or a hot woman from death, and he chooses to save the man. This isn't any real Batman. It's just another contrived story line for the Nolan Nazi merit badge. They are not even subtle. They bang you over the head with their worship of Adolf and Eva. 
 God help the world if this garbage still has a fan base fifty years from now. But it could happen.

155,6761a78eb80a974245cbeebc,RalphRahal,"The Dark Knight (2008), directed by Christopher Nolan, isn’t just another superhero film—it’s a gripping piece of cinema that balances action, emotion, and a deep exploration of morality and chaos. It’s the kind of movie that lingers with you, not because of its spectacle, but because of the questions it asks and the unforgettable performances it delivers. Chief among those is Heath Ledger’s Joker, a portrayal that reshaped how we see villains.
 
 Ledger’s performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary. He’s chaotic and unpredictable, yet his presence is magnetic—every moment he’s on screen feels alive with tension. From his unsettling voice to his haunting laugh, he created a character that’s terrifyingly human yet larger than life. Ledger didn’t just act the part; he became the Joker, and it’s a performance that still sends chills down your spine. It’s no wonder he was awarded a posthumous Oscar—this wasn’t just a role; it was a transformation.
 
 Christian Bale continues to bring depth to Bruce Wayne, exploring his inner conflict and the weight of his decisions as Gotham’s protector. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent adds a tragic layer to the story, showing how even the noblest intentions can be corrupted. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman bring warmth and stability to a world teetering on the edge of chaos.
 
 What really sets The Dark Knight apart, though, is Nolan’s storytelling. He doesn’t just focus on action—though the film has some of the most intense sequences you’ll see—but on creating a story that makes you think. The way it explores the fragile balance between order and chaos, the cost of heroism, and the power of fear, makes it a deeply compelling watch. Add to that the breathtaking visuals and Hans Zimmer’s score, which pulses with urgency, and you’ve got a film that’s as thrilling as it is thought-provoking.
 
 Here’s a fun tidbit: Ledger’s iconic scene where he claps in the jail cell was entirely unscripted. It’s one of those moments that perfectly captures the Joker’s unsettling genius, and it’s all thanks to Ledger’s improvisation.
 
 The Dark Knight is a film that deserves all the praise it gets. It’s intense, thoughtful, and unforgettable, with Heath Ledger delivering one of the most iconic performances of all time. If you haven’t seen it yet—or even if you have—it’s a movie that’s always worth revisiting.",10.0

  “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” (2018) revolves around Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen (Chris Pratt) leading a team back to Isla Nublar to save several species of dinosaurs after an active volcano threatens all life there. The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, but that’s not the way it works out.
 
 My title blurb pretty much says it all for this fifth film in the franchise. I mention Indiana Jones because the movie has a “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981) vibe more so than the other movies. The reference to Dracula’s castle is due to the fact that the entire second half takes place at a cool, gothic chateau in Northern California and there’s a scene with a genetically-enhanced raptor acting like Dracula.
 
 Curvy Bryce is just stunning throughout and easily blows away any other woman in the series. Meanwhile Pratt seriously upped his game as leading action hero (I wasn’t overly impressed with him in the previous film, although I didn’t dislike him either). At the end of the day I’d have to rank this installment as my favorite, followed by the original 1993 movie and 2015’s “Jurassic World.”
 
 The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in Hawaii and England/Scotland.

 This movie falls in the “that was disappointing” category I am afraid. It is obviously that however wrote the story was a lazy bugger that simply rehashed old bits and standard Hollywood cheap concepts and then added some frustrating preaching to it.
 
 The two scenes, one at the beginning and one in the end, where Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) was just sitting and ranting on and on was enough by itself to drag down the movie a star or two. We get it, however wrote that crap do not like gene science. Then go and write a piece in a science journal or something. Oh wait, it would not have been excepted since there was no science in it, just ranting mixed up with poorly hidden religious beliefs. So instead you had to go and ruin a movie which was meant to simply entertain.
 
 The we have the rest of the story. The best, or should I say the kindest, word for describing it would be “predictable”. How many times are we going to do the big company captures animals for profit story? At least try to put some intelligence in the plot if you have to rehash it over and over again. It has even been done before in the same franchise for Christ sake!
 
 I would lie if I did not say that I found, at least, some entertainment watching the movie though. But pretty much all of it came from watching the scenery and the special effects. They at least were pretty good. But then I do like big monsters stomping around wreaking havoc and eating people, especially when it is the bad guys.
 
 There were some parts that was rather funny. I think Christ Pratt, and most of the other actors as well for that matter, did a fairly good job out of the lousy script. The idea of using a Stygimoloch to break free was quite cool and the havoc he wreaked somewhat funny. The part where Wheatley stop in the middle of all the chaos to extract a tooth as a bloody trophy was just silly though.
 
 The end scenes was just frustrating. However wrote that ought to be shot. A few dinosaurs escape and then the conclusion is that humanity have to live side by side with dinosaurs from then one. What a load of rubbish!

 It was 1993 when Jurassic Park was unleashed upon the film loving public, spawning a blockbuster franchise and pop culture thunders in the process. Sadly we now find ourselves suffering cover versions of what was once a great and thought provoking premise with high octane thrills into the bargain.
 
 I guess once they started personalising the Velociraptors, making one of them a friend of man, it was the beginning of the end. But we accepted it - sort of - jumping into 2015's Jurassic World with carefree abandon. More dino carnage we wanted, a bright cast fronted by the ever likable Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard drew us in, but it was merely ok, a franchise entry that was just a quick fix but nothing more. But of course box office talks and the franchise lumbers on to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom...
 
 Plot returns to Isla Nublar which along with all the dinosaur inhabitants is about to be vanished from the planet by the mother of all volcanoes. Cue mankind jostling over whether to save a species that was once extinct whilst others have nefarious motives for financial gain.
 
 Off we go then, stock characters that are over familiar are performed by different actors but go through motions we have witnessed before, whilst the writing strains for a sort of human empathy factor that never hits the mark. There is nothing remotely fresh (well Howard has at least changed her footwear to something more credible) or exciting on offer here, it's a tired cash cow that's in dire need of extinction itself.
 
 Naturally another instalment will come along, and naturally it will make money, with myself and the other millions of Jurassic zombies filing in to view what we hope will be a return to the heady days back in 1993. But it's most likely a forlorn hope, so maybe, just maybe, it should be enough now, enough?  5/10",5.0

 This is a movie that really stretches it as far as believability, logic, or even physics.
 
 First, just a quick note: The trailer makes it seem like the movie spends its time on an island about to blow up. Less than half the movie is that. So, if you're looking for a long drawn out volcanic eruption, look elsewhere.
 
 The heroes are annoying and dumb caricatures, from the techie who's afraid of everything to the wisecracking animal wrangler (in fairness, this is Chris Pratt's character from the previous film, but still). The villains are short-sighted, moustache-twirling dolts who never seem to remember to watch behind them, especially in dangerous scenarios. And why was Jeff Goldblum even in this movie? He serves no purpose to the story. None at all. He's there for them to say, ""See! We have someone from the older movies, so it ties together."" That's literally all he's there to do for his two minutes of screen time.
 
 It's the same plot as every other Jurassic Park/World film. Let's create/genetically engineer dinosaurs. What could possibly go wrong? Even the supposed ""plot twist"" could be figured out from the very beginning of the film. Basic physics don't even apply, such as the impossible truck jump at one point. I swear I could feel my brain leaking out of my ears while watching this.
 
 This film honestly makes me somewhat relieved that Colin Trevorrow got removed from Star Wars Episode IX. Unfortunately, the way this movie ends basically guarantees that there's going to be another one. Although it begs the question about what happened to Jurassic Park III since it ends in a similar way. Is that film even supposed to be canon anymore?

 So let me get a few similarities out of the way. Once again a child is placed at risk, though these precocious kids always seem adept at outrunning dinosaurs even while under a blind panic, so hats off to them. There are of course bad guys on the dinosaur menu, up to at least three in this Jurassic entry. And as usual a couple of times our heroes are saved from certain death by one predator Dino attacking another at the last second. What are the odds?
 
 But it looks like we are finally moving away from the small island off the coast  of Costa Rica, as the island seems to have been destroyed by a volcano eruption that oddly reminded me of the lava damage in Lord of the Rings. Poor dinosaurs. First there was the comet millions of years ago, and now the volcano nearly made the score Universe 2, Dinosaurs 0. But don’t fear, a handful got away and who knows how much DNA?
 
 I am not too impressed by the whole building a super dinosaur thing. Aren’t we reaching a critical mass where they might as well end this franchise and switch to having the monsters be old fashioned alien invaders?
 
 Oh, and Jeff Goldblum is back, though perhaps it was a dry, humorless clone of the original character who was a highlight of previous Jurassic movies, but who sounded like a didactic college professor this time.
 
 But hey, we have seen much worse sequels often, haven’t we? On some surface level, this entry in the franchise was entertaining as always. That seems built into the series’s DNA as well as often accompanying Spielberg’s name in the credits. And it must be frustrating to try and fail to match the magic of the very first film.",6.0

 ""Fast X surprisingly pulls me back into a saga I had practically given up on. Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.
 
 Considering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.
 
 It's clearly the first film in a final trilogy. Interpret this last sentence as you wish.""

385687,6466f564c3514c00e5dc65cd,Ritesh Mohapatra,"A vacous and imbecile action potboiler which does what it's meant to do, ""Entertain"".
 
 Fast X is a noisy actioner which pushes the limits of inventive action set pieces but this time stays grounded compared to the space shit they tried last time. As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. 
 
 The cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.
 
 Overall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.

385687,646b33fa2bcf6700e3bbaa38,CinemaSerf,"Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of ""Dante"" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the ""family"" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from ""Cipher"" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of ""Tej"" (Ludacris) and ""Roman"" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.",6.0

 <em>'Fast X'</em> is a great time. I adore the whole series and have done so since watching the opening entry of it as a teen, sure it has changed tremendously since those halcyonic days of 2001 (OK, I was like 5 then...) but my fondness and enjoyment of these films remains unchanged - quality entertainment!
 
 I love the main cast, particularly those we've had since the beginning or thereabouts - from Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris (I'm gonna need a spin-off with those two if you're reading, Universal!) to Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster (want more of the latter, but I get it's tricky with the absence of Paul Walker; who is still missed). I'll never tire (tyre?) of watching them together.
 
 Away from those guys, the recurrence of the likes of Charlize Theron, John Cena and Nathalie Emmanuel is pleasant and the additions of Brie Larson and Jason Momoa are highly welcomed. I wasn't sure if Momoa was a bit too over the top in parts, but all in all he makes for a memorable antagonist - he certainly commits to the role!

385687,64cca41e2f266b09ef121f56,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"Writing a review for a sequel like “Fast X” feels pretty pointless. It’s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I’m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect “Fast X” to be a film that’s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It’s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.
 
 The plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, “Fast Five.” If you don’t remember the movie, don’t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He’s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his “family” are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.
 
 The story isn’t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about “family” and “faith.” The jokes aren’t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier‘s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman’s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in “F9” seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie — but there’s also plenty to enjoy.
 
 The stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there’s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.
 
 The film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom’s son don’t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).
 
 Although I’m a fan of all things “Fast and Furious,” it’s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. “Fast X” feels like it’s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you’re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it’s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.",5.0
385687,64d05871303c8500ade4b72e,JPV852,"I've more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment, the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie, it's becoming harder and harder to really be entertained, not to mention care one iota about these characters. I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical ""Fast"" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.

385687,6559d34c22931a00c58d4d2f,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This was, of course, a totally ludicrous movie devoid of any pretense of realism or intelligence when it comes to basic science and physics from the script writers. It was however, also a quite fun movie.
 
 It is also a movie free from the usual Hollywood far left woke preaching which is, of course, a big plus.
 
 It is a shame that there is always a bunch of trolls around giving movies like this single star reviews. I mean, come on, what the fuck did you expect? It is a movie exactly in the same style as the last movies in the franchise.
 
 Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel which is a good thing. It is loaded with fun, totally unrealistic but fun, action. I really could have been without Roman’s and Tej’s shenanigans but for the rest I liked the characters and it was nice to see Statham in the movie.
 
 What really made the movie though was to finally see a real, rotten to the core, megalomaniac and charismatic bad guy. Jason Momoa is doing a great job of Dante and I suspect he had quite a bit of fun when doing the role.
 
 Of course there are a few things that drags down the movie.
 
 Things like a 20 kiloton nuclear bomb going of a few hundred meters from the Vatican with “almost” no casualties. That is a new low on unrealism even for the Hollywood hacks.
 
 And what bloody passenger airliner has bomb drop style cargo doors under it?
 
 Even if they did not care about sanity or realism when making the movie there are limits. That drags down the rating as far as I am concerned.
 
 Also, they decided to make this final (?) instalment a two part movie with a huge cliffhanger at the end of this one. I just hate cliffhangers and it makes me automatically reduce the rating.
 
 There was absolutely know need for it. They could just have Dom & Co walk into the sunset plotting their revenge or something instead of this dumbass ending.
 
 At least the good thing is that, unless the Hollywood hacks turns out to be even more stupid than they usually are (which would be quite a feat), part two of this movie will be all about kicking Dante’s arse.",7.0

 This film is the origin story of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), who was first introduced in Batman v. Superman last year. She is born and trained on Themyscira, the hidden island where the powerful warrior women known as the Amazons live. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), an American World War I spy, crashes off the coast of Themyscira and is rescued by Diana and the two team up to take down Ares, the God of War, and the Germans, who are developing a very deadly form of mustard gas. There are fantastic action sequences in this film, especially by Gal Gadot. It's amazing to see her single-handedly storm the German front, inspiring the Allies to fight with her. Gadot takes over from the legendary Linda Carter and makes the role her own. She has great chemistry with Pine. They are complete equals in this film. It's refreshing to see the female lead in a superhero film not be the love interest. The only negative part of the film are the lackluster villains. Hopefully, Wonder Woman will have more formidable foes in future films.",9.0
297762,59358fc692514174a1000015,in_the_crease,"**DC Hits A...Bunt. But compared to the strikeouts, a bunt seems impressive.**
 
 Wonder Woman had some things working for it--things other comic book movies have faltered on. But it had a lot of things not working for it too. The result is an average median between what works and what doesn't. While the film is spectacular within the struggling DCEU, as a stand alone film it's mediocre at best. 
 
 Diana's origin story--how she came to be and how she came to be a super hero was refreshing. It showcased the world of the Amazon warriors. It was unique in the often cookie-cutter super hero origin stories. Patty Jenkins did a good job of framing it, but I think the character's origin story dating back to the comics has always been unique in comparison to other super heroes.
 
 The result is that the first third or so of the movie is satisfying--despite dull performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine (who had zero chemistry as a couple). But once we leave the confines of the island and enter the real world, the movie becomes hit or miss. WWI (that's right, WWI now, not WWII. The reason for the change in setting is never apparent) London is portrayed in a way that is almost a distraction. Yes, the world isn't white washed; diversity is a thing--a wonderful thing at that. But DC's version of Captain America's Howling Commandos consist of an Arab and an American Indian. Diversity for diversity's sake becomes distracting--especially when paired with a low-rent Simon Pegg whose soul function is being a deadly sniper who never fires his weapon (that's helpful on a top-secret mission behind enemy lines). 
 
 It's almost as if the movie telegraphs all of these unnecessary plot hiccups to remind you that this is a super hero film, and no matter how much the mortal humans fail, it will all be okay because the super hero will save the day. 
 
 The dialogue can be clichéd at times, and the final theme of the movie--one of love conquering all and the acknowledgement that, overall, mankind is good, is laughable in it's amateur preachiness. 
 
 But what the film lacks in substance and script, it makes up for in the visuals. I found the action sequences to be great fun. Heavily stylized ""Matrix-style"" fight scenes seem right at home in a film about super hero Gods. The freeze frames worked too--as fight sequences froze in over-the-top super hero poses that harkened back to the source material's comic book roots.
 
 The final confrontation between Wonder Woman and Ares--while dragging on a little long--was well done, being one of the few super hero movie climaxes that delivered. 
 
 While aspects of the movie were so similar (Hell! Identical!) to Captain America: The First Avenger, I actually felt embarrassed for the filmmakers, I did come away thinking this was the movie Captain America should have been. It succeeded in places where Captain America failed miserably. 
 
 The movie is entertainment--pure, fun, pop-corn-gobbling entertainment. In that realm, it succeeds and succeeds well. But as a piece of cinematic art, it falls flat on its face with too many plot holes, script inconsistencies, clichés and mediocre acting. Wonder Woman will be an important movie for both the DCEU and the summer of 2017. But it lacks the magic and staying power of Nolan and Donner's contributions to DC comics' films.",6.0

 This could be mistaken for a mediocre, melodramatic, cheesy TV movie. Visually, it's less interesting than any of the other nu-DC fare; I never thought I'd miss Zach Snyder's sensibility but I did in this flick. Storywise, it may be a step up from the rest of the DCEU, but it still barely rivals the worst of the Marvel movies. Gal Gadot can't act, and Chris Pine couldn't make the clunky dialogue sound not ridiculous.

When I learned that Zack Snyder had his fingers in it I got a worried since he recently wrote such atrocities as Batman vs Superman and sure enough the story is a really the weakest part of the movie. A typical nonsensical, unintelligent, Hollywood story/script were you are better off putting your brain in idle when watching it.  However it makes up for this with cool special effects and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable characters. This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).  There is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana’s gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f… could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?  Another not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge. Well, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?  I definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being “realistic” superhero special effects.  The movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you’re wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.  Anyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie. Enough to give it a 4 out of 5 rating",8.0

 From all the superhero films, this was one of the most anticipated. Mainly because of the woman oriented theme. People were desperate to see the solo woman superhero. Today, we have the great visual effects technology, that anything can be possible to bring on to the screen. And actress like Gal Gadot, even better it gets. Yes, it was a wonderful film. A simple storyline, but a well made film.
 
 The Amazonians who are cut off from the rest of the world, is preparing for the battle if Ares returns. All these years nothing has happened, but one day a fighter pilot crash on the cost of their island. Then the princess embark a journey back with him to find, and end the Ares threat forever. But she only ends up in the WWII, and what happens in the following sequence are the rest of the film.
 
 Who would have done a better job than Patty Jenkins. She nailed it, and so set to direct the sequel too. Even the supporting cast was good. DC's visuals always high standards and so this one. Action sequences too amazing. There's lots of changes in the character, as well as in everything. Firstly a nice superhero costume. And connections like Diana's father, the island, all pretty nicely written out. The DC universe just got extended. I can't wait to see 'Justice League'.

 Near the end of WW1, an American spy (Chris Pine) is chased by Germans to the hidden island of Amazonian women created by Zeus to protect mankind. The princess of the island (Gal Gadot) leaves with the captain to help end the Great War and destroy Ares forever.
 
 ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) combines the Wonder Woman TV series (1975-1979) with elements of “All Quiet on the Western Front” (1979), ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981), “The Dirty Dozen” (1967), “Captain America: The First Avenger” (2011) and “Man of Steel” (2013). It’s a well done modern superhero flick and superior to both “The First Avenger” and “Man of Steel.”
 
 The opening paradisal island sequence is good without overstaying its welcome. The story really picks up when Captain Steve Trevor and Diana depart the island. They have great chemistry and their relationship adds human interest. 
 
 Unlike “Man of Steel,” which devolved into super-beings constantly pulverizing each other in the second half, “Wonder Woman” has the poise to take its time and establish an interesting assortment of characters. The entire midsection is great, but the last act, to be expected, comes down to two super-beings pounding each other. But at least the creators tried to add a weighty moral.  
 
 The film runs 2 hours, 21 minutes.

 ...I do NOT think that Wonder Woman is the greatest female protagonist in an action movie or sci-fi movies...and I am NOT a misogynist.
 
 My ""lack of respect"" of Wonder Woman doesn't stem from a hatred of strong female leads...I just think Sarah Conner (Especially in ""Terminator the Sarah Conner Chronicles"") is the absolute coolest and most bada$$ strong female lead that has ever graced the silver screen or your home television.
 
 Not only that, I was livid when it got canceled and, for the cherry on top, if you want a strong female role model...have one with the cold soldier discipline and the willingness to sacrifice her life for the mission that Sarah Conner has.
 
 Not only that, but to be further controversial, I don't believe that Wonder Woman is the first awesome strong female lead in an action movie. I mean, Ellen Ripely is almost as pure awesome as Sarah Conner...and who can forget Buffy, OK Buffy is touchy, when I mention her I am talking about Buffy from the TV show, not Buffy from the movie.
 
 Those are only to name a few. And then there are lesser ones that we hate yet still came before Wonder Woman....most recently the Ghost Busters and Mary Sue from the new Star Wars.
 
 So cool down on the politics...people that don't think Wonder Woman is the greatest female lead aren't necessarily misogynists forcing a male agenda....they may just be aware of Sarah Conner and Echo.
 
 Now...back to Wonder Woman.
 
 WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE DARK, REALISTIC, AND GRITTY?!?!?! Seriously, I only like one (1) of the Nolan Batman movies and...Wonder Woman and Superman and the Justice League are NOT Batman.
 
 I don't want to sit through a Super Hero movie that is bucking for ultra-realistic. If I wanted that, I'd see a drama.
 
 There are few super heroes that you can go totally dark and Gritty with, Batman, Dare Devil, Green Arrow....
 
 Speaking of Green Arrow, notice how he was dark and the Flash wasn't? Why can the WB understand this but not the film department? What you have here is a director trying to make a Batman movie using Wonder Woman and that doesn't work. If I want a dark and gritty female action protagonist I already have the Terminator and Alien franchises.
 
 the director, the studio, the writers should have concentrated more on making a Wonder Woman film and not another Batman movie...this failed for the same reason Batman V Superman did.",10.0
297762,66d615ac7dddc48ba99b897b,tmdb51616167,"""Wonder Woman"" was a groundbreaking film that revitalized the DC universe and reignited excitement for the Justice League. Gal Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman, while criticized for her acting skills, was visually captivating and suited the role perfectly. The film's World War I setting and character interactions added depth to the storyline, with quick wit enhancing the overall experience. The fight scenes were exhilarating, showcasing Wonder Woman's badass persona and making the movie a must-watch despite any shortcomings in acting.
 
 On the other hand, ""Wonder Woman 1984"" failed to live up to its predecessor, delivering a disjointed and disappointing sequel that veered off course from the established DC universe. The film's messy plot, lackluster excitement, and underdeveloped villain undermined the legacy created by the first movie. Director Patty Jenkins' handling of the story and character arcs fell short, leaving viewers with a subpar viewing experience marred by excessive CGI and a lack of substance.
 
 Ultimately, ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was deemed a misstep in the Wonder Woman franchise, failing to capture the magic of the original film and disappointing fans with its lackluster execution. The film's flaws overshadowed any potential it may have had, leaving audiences longing for a more cohesive and engaging continuation of Wonder Woman's story.",8.0

 One thing that would be 100% guaranteed prior to the release of Jurassic World, is that whatever the quality, or lack of, the notices would be mixed. Thus the reactions would be akin to those that ""Indiana Jones 4"" received, charges of ruining childhoods and franchises etc.
 
 Jurassic World does exactly what is expected of it, it's a popcorn blockbuster that plays out as mindless fun, complete with outstanding effects, monster mayhem and moments of dumbness. In fact it's very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg's deft touch.
 
 There's a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick. The writers introduce a couple of new mighty monsters to the series, hell of beasties for sure, while the photography, stunt work and musical score all impress greatly.
 
 The Velociraptor plot line is crummy and daft, almost as daft as Bryce's high heels character arc, and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times, but it's a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like it's some sort of series disgrace. 7/10",7.0

135397,58d554b19251411fd502e9fe,Bulletproof5FDP,"**Jurassic World: A Jurassic Disappointment**
 
 As a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, especially the first movie, I am quite disappointed with Jurassic World. I was honestly super stoked for the long-awaited sequel to Jurassic Park, but in the end, the movie lacked the charm and mysticism from Jurassic Park. From poorly-developed characters (with the exception of Chris Pratt's Owen Grady) to idiotic plot elements, Jurassic World's only saving grace is the fact that it's a sequel to Jurassic Park. 
 
 The dinosaurs honestly look awful and pale in comparison to the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. The CGI is so obvious and doesn't look realistic at all. Jurassic Park found the right balance of practical effects and computer-generated imagery, giving viewers the feeling that the dinosaurs feel so life-like. Jurassic World basically uses minimal practical effects in favor of CGI galore. It's sad that a 1993 movie has better CGI than a movie made in 2015.
 
 Claire and her nephews Gray and Zach, are cheap imitations of John Hammond and his grandchildren Tim and Lex. Claire is primarily motivated by greed and exploiting the dinosaurs. Hoskins just wants to use the dinosaurs as military weapons. Dr. Henry Wu is a bit more antagonistic, revealed to be secretly creating hybrids for Hoskins as military weapons. The only character that's given some form of development is Owen Grady, played by Star-Lord a.k.a Chris Pratt. His motivations are for researching Velociraptor behavior and actually treats the dinosaurs like living creatures and not just exploited science experiments. Honestly the only redeeming factor throughout the entire movie.
 
 The Indominus Rex tricks the personnel into thinking it's escaped confinement by clawing away at the top of its enclosure. They somehow believe the dinosaur escaped, but wouldn't security be alerted right away? The enclosure doesn't come equipped with bells and whistles? To much surprise (not), the Indominus is actually inside the enclosure with them. This idiotic plot choice allows the Indominus to escape.
 
 Zack and Grey revisiting the original site of Jurassic Park brought back so many nostalgic memories of Jurassic Park. One of the best moments of the entire movie, absolutely loved when they picked up the Jurassic Park banner and the goggles used by Tim. But what killed the moment was when they managed to get the original Jeep started. It's been sitting for over 20 years, non-operational. But for plot convenience, they learned how to fix vehicles previously. 
 
 I thought the assault upon the park attendees by the pterosaurs was chilling, swooping up people in the process. Gave a sense of terror that you could actually feel. One of those people being Zara, Claire's assistant. She is attacked by a pteranodon and then eventually eaten alive by the mosasaurus. Her death was just way too drawn out and totally undeserving. A death like this should have been reserved for the villain.
 
 The final battle between the Indominus Rex and Owen's pack of surviving Velociraptor brought me back to the battle between the T-Rex and raptors in Jurassic Park. Then Claire brings out the T-Rex, the very same one from Jurassic Park, and manages to outrun the T-Rex IN HEELS. I was rooting for the T-Rex to win, then the Mosasaurus swoops up and drags the Indominus into the lagoon. 
 
 Though this movie attempts to bring back the Jurassic Park charm, it ultimately fails to capture that same magic. Unlike The Force Awakens, another similar movie that calls back to its roots, Jurassic World managed to be much worse than its source material. You feel no true connection to the characters or dinosaurs, the excitement factor is gone, and the music is not memorable at all. 
 
 My Rating: 5.5/10.0",6.0
135397,5b960066925141431c02bd8a,Gimly,"Most assuredly the best sequel to _Jurassic Park_, but it doesn't touch the original. ""Not being as good as a different movie"" is not what's bad about _Jurassic World_ though, what is though is the dropped plotlines, unlikeable characters, haphazard mixing of respect and disrespect for the original at random intervals, a **complete** lack of chemistry between any two characters whatsoever, but most of all the romantic leads, underdeveloped arcs of both characters and story, more Deus Ex Machinas than you can shake a stick at, and some of the most painful dialogue I've seen in a Hollywood flick all year.
 
 But there's Bryce Dallas Howard proving (when given the chance) she's an acting force, which was a particularly pleasant surprise given that the last thing I saw her in was _Spider-Man 3_. Chris Pratt doesn't for a moment make you believe he is anyone other than Chris Pratt, but Chris Pratt is a pretty rad dude so that's more or less a chip in the film's favour.

 It brings with it the usual elements of this film franchise: the children (not the thousand extras who run around but two we care about), whose mission is to get themselves into the path of extreme danger; the somewhat evil guy who presumably will also end up being Dino food; raptors who get smarter and stronger with every film; and footage of the original Jurassic theme park in case we are in danger of forgetting its roots.
 
 I try not to notice stuff like how extras can never outrun dinosaurs but the stars always manage it.  It is just entertainment, after all. Let’s not overthink it. And I question whether a company that must be so susceptible to lawsuits in its day to day operation would really create more dangerous creatures because they need new thrill rides. Wouldn’t they be more apt to create more up close and personal rides or experiences with the existing ones? Especially the herbivores? If a customer needs more excitement than standing near a 100-foot tall dinosaur, maybe they need to scale back their drug intake, or go climb Mt. Everest.

 Jurassic World perfectly blends the nostalgia of the original movies with a new grand scale, incredible effects, and big stars. Hollywood’s flood of reboots and remakes rarely capture the heart and quality of the original source, but Jurassic World stands out as one of the best. Chris Pratt’s tough and lovable rogue, Owen Grady, brings the action. At the same time, Bryce Dallas Howard’s high-stung and successful business executive, Claire Dearing, grows and develops from selfish career focus to respecting nature and valuing family. Every scene feels grandiose and epic, with a bigger park, bigger attractions, and bigger dinosaurs. The childlike wonder still shines through, with kids giddy at a dino petting zoo and crowds cheering as the Mosasaurus feeds on a great white shark. The scares are back, too, with deadlier predators and plenty of hapless park employees to hunt. While the Jurassic series has its ups and downs, Jurassic World is at its peak!",9.0

What he can't devour, his eager - recently released - friends from elsewhere in the park are plenty keen on too - so we quickly find ourselves with a ""containment anomaly"" that leads to a distinct carnage scenario for our hero to avert. As ever, Pratt brings oodles of personality to his role as the velociraptor's pal, but the rest of the cast - to an human - are poor. The kids grate and ought to have been eaten very early on, and gazillionaire Irrfan Khan (""Masrani"") is way to dapper and refined to be a convincing baddie. Vincent D'Onofio tries to help out, at least his part has some meat to it, but otherwise this is just a cracking victory for Pratt and some outstanding visual effects without even a rousing score from John Williams to rely upon and some storylines that are contrived to maximise the menace and minimise the plausibility. If you can find it showing on a big screen anywhere, then it is still worth watching on a wet afternoon, but it loses much of any potency it ever had on the small screen and I'm not sure I'd bother again.",6.0

238,5346fa840e0a265ffa001e20,futuretv,"The Godfather Review by Al Carlson
 
 The Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.
 The Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.
 The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.
 Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. 
 This film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.",10.0

 It's written by a mobster with the sole intention of depicting the lead mobsters as demi gods. Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the ""Mafia"" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.
 This is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.
 The movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them.

The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother ""Fredo"" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made.

238,6761a745b80a974245cbee9e,RalphRahal,"The Godfather (1972), directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece that redefined storytelling in film. Based on Mario Puzo’s bestselling novel, the movie seamlessly blends crime drama with an epic exploration of power, loyalty, and family. Every frame is a testament to Coppola’s brilliance, as he transforms a gripping tale into a timeless work of art.
 
 At the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando’s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.
 
 Coppola’s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the “Prince of Darkness,” enhances the film’s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota’s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.
 
 A fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history.
 
 The Godfather isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience. It’s a study of power and morality, a family saga, and a crime thriller all rolled into one. Its influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its performances, direction, and storytelling remain unparalleled. This is a film that stands the test of time, and for good reason: it’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",10.0

The acting and writing vie for the award for being the blandest - especially the shockingly wooden Cameli, and the whole thing recycles itself to the point where I was quickly on the side of the perpetrator of these dastardly goings-on. What’s more annoying is that the plot did have some potential; it could have been better had the director relied less on the tried and tested formulae and taken a few risks with the story.

1232546,68378d9d3a7f0b5781838eea,MovieGuys,"""Until Dawn"" is what I call ""Scoobie Do"" for adults. There's a group of pals, out for a vacation romp, who find themselves facing a mysterious back story and lots of supernatural baddies, out to croak them, in bloody style.
 
 What makes this even worse than the usual formulaic, survivalist, horror nonsense, is its story is based upon a time loop. So, in essence, this is a horror flick, with obsessive compulsive disorder. The murder and mayhem repeats itself, stripping away even the basic sense of the unknown, as we stop wondering and worrying over, who is going to die and when. 
 
 I can see how this would work in the context of a video game, which this film, is based upon. In games players die over and over, until they finally find a way to beat the game. As a film, its not a great idea, at all. A sense of lethargy and boredom sets in, as everyone dies over and over again. 
 
 Without sounding too negative, there is a limited upside. The atmosphere of dread is well established, creature effects are reasonable, as is acting, from the cast. The deaths are varied too, so its not wholly a case of deja vu. 
 
 In summary, a basic watch that breaks the first rule of survivalist  horror, with everyone dying, repeatedly. In turn, the sense of urgency and threat is dissipated, leading to a somewhat tedious, fundamentally repetitive, watch.",6.0

 It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.
 
 You jump - I jump.
 
 Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.
 
 Never let go.
 
 So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go.

597,62a08f2e12197e565ea45214,CinemaSerf,"Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS ""Titanic"", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young ""Dawson"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy ""Rose"" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée ""Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother ""Ruth"" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, ""Rose"" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young ""Dawson"" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer ""Lovejoy"" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older ""Rose"" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television.",7.0

597,63ef88b95cc11d0086123924,Nathan,"Titanic is simply a masterpiece. This movie has it all. A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here.
 
 Before I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch.
 
 Back to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me.
 
 The performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton.
 
 This film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well.
 
 Overall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it.
 
 Score: 96% |
 Verdict: Masterpiece
 
 On a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.",10.0

597,676476c20c865f24891f6a2b,RalphRahal,"Titanic (1997), directed by James Cameron, is one of those films that never loses its impact, no matter how many times you watch it. Some might call it overrated, but it’s hard to deny the emotional weight and the sheer craftsmanship that went into making it. Rewatching it reminded me why it’s stood the test of time, it’s a great mix of story, performances, and technical execution.
 
 Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver standout performances as Jack and Rose. Their chemistry is natural and believable, and it’s what drives the story forward. The drawing scene is iconic for many reasons, both on and off the screen. Interestingly, it wasn’t DiCaprio sketching Rose, it was actually James Cameron himself. Cameron, who’s also an artist, added a personal touch to the scene by creating the famous drawing. Behind the scenes, Winslet knew the scene could be awkward since it involved nudity and was one of their first together, so she flashed DiCaprio to help him relax. Even with that, he was nervous and flubbed his line, saying, “Lie on that bed… uh, couch” instead of just “couch.” The mistake stayed in the film, and it adds a little authenticity to the moment.
 
 Visually, Titanic is impressive on every level. The production design is meticulous. From the luxurious first-class interiors to the gritty third-class quarters, every set looks authentic and lived-in. The cinematography captures both the intimacy of Jack and Rose’s relationship and the overwhelming scale of the disaster. The sinking sequence is still one of the most intense and well-executed moments in film. Cameron used a mix of practical effects, real sets, and CGI to recreate the chaos, and it all blends seamlessly. The result is a scene that’s visually stunning and emotionally gripping.
 
 The final act ties everything together perfectly. Rose’s memories, paired with James Horner’s haunting score, deliver an emotional gut punch. That last shot is unforgettable and leaves you thinking long after the credits roll.
 
 Titanic isn’t just about a historical tragedy or a love story, it’s a film about human connection and the choices we make when everything’s on the line. Cameron’s attention to detail, paired with strong performances and excellent storytelling, makes this one of the most impactful films ever made. Overrated? Maybe. But it’s a benchmark in filmmaking for a reason.",9.0

Reminds me of **_The Princess Bride_**, this film may be ""dumb"" but it's definitely a movie that will be and has been praised for many years.",8.0

 Hits all the tropes and notes you'd expect, but elevated by the writing.  
 
 First major work from Finn and Billy as writer/director/actor team and solidly puts them on the map as a team to keep an eye on.  
 
 Characters are real, writing is tight, shot selection is efficient.  Sound is a bit inconsistent, but I think it's because some folks strained their voices.  Kills are impactful and mostly practical, but not gratuitous.  
 Does not overstay its welcome and remains entertaining throughout.  Not going to win any awards, but worth your time.

1064213,672242e41d0b571b8a5c2034,Brent Marchant,"We’re all familiar with the old adage that, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It’s a notion that applies not only to what can happen in everyday life, but also to what shows up on the big screen, as the latest feature from writer-director Sean Baker illustrates. This widely acclaimed indie offering follows the misadventures of a Brooklyn lap dancer/sex worker (Mikey Madison) who falls for the insanely rich, self-absorbed, wildly irresponsible son of a Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn). Together they take the plunge into an edgy, wacked-out fairy tale, a dark storybook romance strung out on steroids, quaaludes and crack. Their whirlwind affair soon lands them in Las Vegas, culminating in a green card wedding that junior’s mobster parents (Darya Ekamasova, Aleksey Serebryakov) want annulled at any cost, even if it means calling on their oily, bumbling posse of cronies and heavies (Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Yura Borisov) to lean on the alleged lovebirds. But achieving that goal ultimately proves more difficult than imagined. As a cross-country chase ensues, a string of frenzied events leaves mom, dad and friends infuriated and the Gothamite Cinderella disillusioned, having erroneously thought she’d truly hit the jackpot this time. From this, one might easily think this premise has a solid foundation for an outrageous, uproarious comedy, but, sadly, the film lives up to its potential only some of the time. To be sure, there is some genuinely hysterical, wonderfully inventive material here, but it only hits the mark about half the time. What’s more, much of the story (especially in the film’s first half) is predictable, almost clichéd, with some bits dragging on needlessly long. Indeed, I’m somewhat mystified as to what all the critical fuss is about, something perhaps best evidenced by the picture’s capture of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. I readily admit to being a fan of Baker’s work, having immensely enjoyed his previous efforts “Red Rocket” (2021), “The Florida Project” (2017) and “Tangerine” (2015). But I’m genuinely at a loss to understand the level of praise that’s been lavished on this release. It’s a capable film in a number of respects, but the filmmaker clearly has done better, and those prior offerings make better viewing options in my opinion. Don’t fall for all the hype here, as this really is one of those cases of something being too good to be true.",6.0
1064213,6735becdd4ffba1e8b2adf0e,CinemaSerf,"""Ani"" (Mikey Madison) works as a private dancer in New York when she is asked by her boss to go look after some visiting Russians. That's when she encounters the young ""Vanya"" (Mark Eydelshteyn). He's pretty drunk, completely stoned and has more money than God. He wants a dance, he wants much more - but that's not allowed in the club, so he invites her to his luxury pad next day for fun. She actually quite likes his youthful exuberance - and his cash - and after a few days, a Russian sable coat, and a trip to Vegas, they find themselves marred. Social media now takes an hand and his oligarch mother hears news that her son has married an hooker. Livid, she instructs her local fixer ""Toros"" (Karren Karagulian) to sort the mess out. He duly sends his two enforcers to the house where all hell promptly breaks loose. ""Garnick"" (Vache Tovmasyan) and ""Tom"" (Anton Bitter) are merely to detain the pair until their boss arrives to insist that marriage is going to be annulled; ""Ani"" is having none of that and ""Vanya"" - well he's just a little bit conflicted and quickly things start to go pear-shaped! This film starts off strongly with an entertaining courtship scenario played out between two actors who really do look like they are enjoying themselves. Eydelshteyn delivers enthusiastically and acrobatically, there's loads of sex and quite witty dialogue that plays nicely on the language barriers. Once the second phase of the film starts, though, it runs out of steam a little. ""Vanya"" doesn't feature so much and the story becomes a little less engaging as the rather too gentle thugs and the increasingly irate girl try to get everyone to the courthouse for the ruling before his angry mother arrives. That leaves us with too much overacting from Karagulian and some increasingly implausible scenarios as the air is gradually let out of the thing and it comes to end rather disappointingly. At it's best, though, the first hour is quickly paced and takes an amiable swipe at the sex trade and the players who make and take from it. Certainly worth a watch, it just hasn't quite the courage of it's initial convictions.",7.0
1064213,67a5f171f196a73ae76715f7,RalphRahal,"Anora is a film that starts off strong, pulling you in with an intriguing setup and a well-paced first act. It follows a story that keeps you invested, blending drama with some unexpected humor. The second act stretches a bit longer than needed, but it's clear that was intentional to build atmosphere and let certain themes play out. While the pacing is deliberate, it sometimes feels like it's lingering in places that don't add much depth to the characters. That being said, the buildup is engaging, even if the payoff leaves something to be desired.
 
 Sean Baker's directing is solid, capturing a raw, almost documentary-like feel that makes the film feel real and immersive. He knows how to make everyday settings feel alive and uses long takes effectively. The cinematography complements this, keeping things grounded with natural lighting and handheld shots that add an almost voyeuristic feel to the story. It’s visually well-crafted, even if it doesn’t aim for anything particularly stylized. The way the camera lingers on certain moments adds weight to the film's themes, even when the script doesn’t fully explore them.
 
 Mikey Madison delivers a standout performance, carrying much of the film. She brings a layered energy to the role, making her character feel both confident and vulnerable when needed. The supporting cast does their job well, but the script doesn't give them much depth to work with. That’s one of the film’s weaknesses, while it sets up an interesting premise and characters, it doesn’t fully flesh them out. You get a sense of their motivations, but not much beyond that. The dialogue is sharp in some moments but feels underdeveloped in others, leaving certain interactions feeling a bit hollow.
 
 The score and sound design are subtle, used more for atmosphere than standout moments. The film relies heavily on natural sounds and ambient noise, which works well for its grounded approach. It enhances the realism but doesn't do much to elevate the emotions of the film. 
 
 Overall, Anora is a well-directed and well-acted film that keeps you engaged, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing. If you’re looking for a character-driven story with a raw, unfiltered feel, it’s worth a watch, but don’t expect a big payoff in the end.",7.0
1064213,67c26fa0bc6935a001a2838a,r96sk,"<em>'Anora'</em> is an absolute cracker! The film is unadulterated chaos, I honestly needed the silentness of it ending so I could relax. As usual, I'm not one to judge it on its deep-rooted meaning or whatever, I'll leave that to others, all I can say is that it's a blast and I unequivocally loved it.
 
 Mikey Madison's performance is sensational, quite the showing indeed! Apparently I've seen her in three other things (much less prominent roles, admittedly) before, evidently I don't remember her from those - but safe to say, I won't be forgetting Madison from this at any point. Superb!
 
 Away from the star performer, Mark Eydelshteyn makes the most out of his role. The trio of Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan and Yura Borisov are great comedic support. I've seen Aleksei Serebryakov here and there down the years and he always plays the same roles, I like him though.
 
 The 139 minutes go by in a flash, with the utterly chaotic nature it is no surprise. It isn't the most difficult movie to predict given that you are waiting for the crap to hit the fan, but how it gets to that point is a wild ride to witness - the concluding scene is stand out, too.
 
 I still have three more of the nominees to watch, but this overtakes <em>'The Substance'</em> as the film that would hypothetically get my vote for Best Picture; not that I take much value from that (or any other) awards ceremony. It'll take some beating!",10.0

1064213,67ef84d5f5a80aa5459933d8,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"Despite a very rough start, “Anora” ultimately offers a unique and entertaining exploration of the humanity behind sex work and the complexities of love, pain, and trauma. I was so close to giving up on the film during its excruciating opening thirty minutes, which I found dull, grating, and gratuitous. The early part of the movie is laden with an unnecessary and gratuitous parade of explicit scenes and a focus on unlikable characters doing uninteresting things. Now I am thankful that I didn’t storm out of the theater, because the eventual payoff is more than worth the investment.
 
 As I reflect on the film, I’ve come to the realization that the style and tone of the film’s opening half hour might be more intentional than I first thought. Writer and director Sean Baker, known for his ability to capture the lives of marginalized people with empathy and complexity in his previous works “The Florida Project” and “Tangerine,” appears to be making a deliberate statement. The first act, with its emphasis on the superficial, transactional view of sex work, feels almost intentionally alienating, highlighting how society often reduces sex workers to mere objects of desire that exist solely to be used, abused, and discarded. It’s designed to make viewers uncomfortable, mostly because it seems to be a critique of how these people are seen as less than human. Sex workers like Anora are often dismissed as disposable rather than as individuals with depth and feelings.
 
 Once the film transitions into the second act, it gains momentum and its true heartbeat emerges. The focus shifts to Anora (Mikey Madison), a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries a powerful Russian oligarch’s playboy son, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn). As news of the marriage reaches Russia, it threatens to derail her new life. Ivan’s parents are infuriated and head to New York to have the union annulled. The plot sounds like a simple and goofy romantic comedy, but it becomes more layered as the film progresses.
 
 Baker excels in depicting characters on the fringes of society, and Anora is no exception. She’s flawed, complicated, and completely human in her desire to be happy, safe, and loved. As we get to know the character better, her strength, resilience, and vulnerability shines through. It’s a real testament to how much Baker understands his characters and the environments they inhabit. They are never caricatures but relatable, normal people caught up in difficult, often tragic circumstances. And this, I think, is where the film really succeeds.
 
 It’s a serious story that takes an unexpected turn when a trio of bumbling criminal characters show up, adding some much-needed levity and energy to the film. The comedic angle is strange but also highly entertaining, which provides a nice contrast to the tension-filled dramatic elements. The humor balances the more serious undertones of the story and injects an unexpected freshness into the film, making it easier (and a lot more fun) to invest in Anora’s journey.
 
 What’s really going to have audiences talking is the ending, and it’s the place where the film leaves its most notable mark. I can imagine the final frame will be analyzed and discussed and misunderstood, but it’s one of the most profound, heartbreaking, and touching conclusions I’ve seen this year.
 
 WARNING: I am issuing a spoiler alert for the next paragraph. Please stop reading now if you’ve not yet seen the film.
 
 When Igor (Yura Borisov) and Anora are together in the final act, this isn’t a typical “rescue” or “knight in shining armor” trope that you’d expect to find in a romantic film. Their sad and painful attempt at intimacy is a deeply meaningful and emotional recognition between two people who have been hurt by the world in similar ways. It’s a poignant reminder that love and healing often come from shared experiences of pain, and that empathy can transcend even the most complicated circumstances. It’s just so heartbreaking and sad, and I’m not sure there’s another film that’s so accurately or sensitively conveyed a person’s haunting emotional wounds with such authenticity.
 
 It goes without saying that despite a miserable opening, “Anora” ultimately won me over. This is a flawed but compelling story about a woman reclaiming her agency, confronting the societal labels placed on her, and finding something profoundly human in a world that seeks to strip her of it.
 
 By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",
1064213,67f7c135cce7690230ad1d64,badelf,"Sean Baker's Oscar-winning ""Anora"" presents a peculiar paradox of contemporary cinema: a film celebrated for its supposed boundary-pushing that ultimately offers little beyond its taboo subject matter. At 139 minutes, Baker's tale of a sex worker who briefly marries into Russian wealth before facing brutal rejection stretches a thin premise far beyond its natural breaking point.
 
 Mikey Madison delivers a performance of remarkable depth, finding nuanced humanity in a character that the screenplay itself seems uninterested in fully exploring. Her work transcends the material, suggesting emotional complexities the script merely gestures at. Madison deserves every accolade for creating a compelling person where the screenplay offers only a situation.
 
 The film's moments of genuine comedy provide welcome relief but highlight the fundamental problem: ""Anora"" mistakes setting (sex work) for substance. When compared to Jean-Luc Godard's ""Vivre sa Vie,"" which used prostitution as a lens to examine profound questions of autonomy, capitalism, and gender, Baker's film feels superficial. Godard achieved more philosophical depth in 83 minutes than Baker manages in over two hours.
 
 Contemporary cinema increasingly confuses progressive subject matter with progressive thinking. Merely depicting marginalized experiences without offering fresh insight or formal innovation becomes a hollow exercise. One cannot help but wonder whether ""Anora"" received accolades for what it attempted to say rather than what it actually achieved.
 
 The central narrative - a woman from difficult circumstances discovering she can be loved for herself - is neither original nor developed with particular insight. What might have been a focused, powerful short film instead becomes a meandering feature that suggests profundity without delivering it.
 
 Baker's technical competence is evident, but technical skill alone cannot disguise the absence of a compelling artistic vision. ""Anora"" ultimately represents cinema that has forgotten the difference between depicting life and illuminating it.",5.0

For instance, they didn't really explore the loving side of Superman that is the reason for saving humans.  But i get it that this could just be a different interpretation of his motives. The relationship between Clark and Lois was almost spontaneous and didn't really develop. Not to mention there was so much action! Sure this is Superman and he deserves a big movie, but that action is just so mind numbing and distracts from the plot. I really did like how they explored Clarks childhood just enough to give justification to his emotions. Although there are criticism about the ending, I thought it was well made. Clark spent his entire youth listening to his father to control himself and he had to learn to make a tough decision. I think this movie has a lot of potential for a sequel if they do it right.

 You can really feel Christopher Nolan's touch in the script and, probably, that's the problem. It is just too similar to Batman Begins. Also, the script repeats Batman's stupidities like the way in which Klark Kent father dies or feeling that Crowe, Superman's father, has everything under control, even his own stupid death.
 
 Tons of FX with incredible fights that may feel exhausting for some but that I think are totally justified in this character.

 Sure, if what you wanted was a wild action ride and unchecked destruction then this movie will most likely satisfy you. However, as a “Superman” movie it just did not feel right to me.
 
 The original story is tweaked and tinkered with too much. The Kryptonians, not only General Zod and his minions, are portrayed in a quite negative light. Superman himself project a hugely negative aura. Lois Lane gets to meet Superman and learn who he really is before he even starts to work for The Daily Planet. And so on and so forth…
 
 The first part of the movie with the back-flashes, with Kal-El just trying to hide, getting bullied etc. is just sad and even boring. It is not until General Zod arrives that things starts to get going. However even then they continue to tinker with things. Apparently it is now enough to breathe Krypton-like air for him to lose his powers. This is just so wrong. Actually, the entire bla bla when they try to “explain” his powers is just dumb. There is an established story behind Superman. Even though it is fantastic and unscientific just stick to it. It is a fantasy comic character after all. Leave it at that. The story itself is not bad but it is not Superman.
 
 Having said all that, when the fighting starts, the special effects and the action definitely have a high “coolness factor”. Superman and General Zod wrecks more havoc than half a dozen Godzillas with a bad case of hangover. Actually the level of mayhem is bordering on the ridiculous but it was fun to watch.

 The first few scenes, whilst nothing exceptional, are actually perfectly OK - I thought so, anyway. Though pretty much from the introduction of a young Calypso (no hate on Ariana DeBose btw, I like her and she tries) the movie quickly spirals. The characters of Russell Crowe and Alessandro Nivola (he, too, tries) are, to put it kindly, rather irritating.
 
 Christopher Abbott's role has some potential attached to it, though that countdown thing got repetitive real fast; almost as quick as 1... 2... nevermind. The stuff with Fred Hechinger's part, meanwhile, is bizarre, sure it makes sense based on his (bad) final scene but the whole voice bit felt silly at every moment; esp. when imitating Crowe's Nikolai.
 
 Probably for the best that this character and franchise ends here.",4.0

Well, yes, but if that's the only card a film has then you might as well get your shirt off and play it! Sadly, that is all that can really be said for this plodding superhero adventure. The ""Kravinoff"" siblings ""Dimi"" (Billy Barratt) and ""Sergei"" (Levi Miller) are taken out of their posh school by their oligarch father (Russell Crowe) and taken on a hunt in Ghana to develop their masculinity. They are on the trail of a lion called ""Czar"" and it's an encounter with him and then with a local girl called ""Calypso"" (Diaana Babnicova) that sees the latter brother emerge injured but changed. Quite profoundly changed too! Skip on many years and the ""Sergei"" (now Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has no relationship with his father, though is still in contact with his brother (now Fred Hechinger), and he has developed some remarkably animalistic ninja skills. He's the ultimate in natural forces for good. Meantime, though, things are hotting up amongst the criminal fraternity and a chance re-encounter with a grown up ""Calypso"" (Ariana DeBose) sets up a denouement with a nasty baddie who has to survive on refrigerated gel packs from his rucksack else he gets especially thick-skinned. Along the way there are several, quite violent, escapades that allow the star to show off his physical prowess, Crowe to show off his thick Siberian accent and Hechinger to look about as weedy as possible. Thereafter there isn't an original bone in it's CGI-fest of a body. The script is actually pretty diabolical and the plot really struggles to get off the ground as this lumbers, quite literally, along for over two hours. It's as if it were a few episodes of a mini-series hastily condensed into a film; it's bitty, disjointed and the denouement is all rather underwhelming.

 Firstly, this is a fresh, down to earth, departure from your standard Marvel Franchise films.Idiots in over bright Lycra or Spandex  outfits, are, thankfully, absent. 
 
 Instead, you get a more conventional, satisfyingly  believable, character. One who happens to be have been given special powers, that feel primal and earthy, compared, for example, to hammers and lighting bolts.

I would have liked to see how the story arc would have gone in future films but unfortunately it probably won't get a sequel.
 
 My advice to anyone watching movies these days is go see it yourself and don't believe the charged reviews.
 
 I thought the story was good, the acting was fine and the special effects were done well and more grounded and gritty than your normal super hero movies.  Kraven was another antihero type in this film and I think that worked well for his introduction.

120,51ea51a4760ee3602024a27e,NeoBrowser,"Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.
 
 Fellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).
 
 With those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.
 
 Leaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.
 
 There are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.
 
 More importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...
 
 
 Verdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.

120,5aa3628dc3a3687bfc004d51,Wuchak,"Tolkien’s adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws.
 
 RELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular ‘Fellowship of the Ring,’ to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. 
 
 The rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        
 
 This three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it’d be sinful to give it a lower rating. 
 
 There are problems, however, at least for those who aren’t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could’ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn’t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  
 
 Fifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren’t much more than glorified cameos. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. 
 
 Despite these negatives, “The Fellowship of the Ring” is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.

120,5c15adc5c3a36866cc3713d9,LadyGreenEyes,"Overall, I give this four stars.  Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four.  
 
 The casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.
 
 Then we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!  
 
 The sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of 
 Middle Earth, everything we saw was just right.  
 
 The only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.  
 
 All in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.  Classics, worth collecting and treasuring.",8.0

120,5fa9aeb521621d003ff9c55f,Peter McGinn,"Well, I wouldn’t read this review if you are a true fan of fantasy adventure epics, because I am not. Don’t get me wrong, I like this movie and have watched it a few times over the years, but I have watched  (or read, for that matter) very little else in the fantasy  genre. I didn’t get too far into the Game of Thrones as the violent rapes got old for me fast. 
 
 So I watched this first entry of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as just a viewer, not a fan, and I liked it just fine. The complex plot held together well and the scenery was gorgeous. There was violence, but not gore, and for those who don’t like war movies, there wasn’t as much of it here as there is in the other two films of the trilogy.
 
 I gather the elfin roles for women were enlarged and brought to the fore, and why not; women were mostly good for setting mead and large pieces of rare meat down on tables in front of their warrior men.
 
 I must confess, I found it jarring that the warriors like Strider were so invincible, walking into a horde of sixty orcs and scattering them like toy soldiers with his sword. I know they are epic heroes, but if I’m an orc, I stand back and throw something or whatever, but it is similar to the old legends with semi-gods like Achilles, back when Hector was a pup.
 
 I am not going to compare the film to the book — I read it decades ago when I was in high school. It is worth watching and though real fans will take this with a large grain of salt, I think it is possibly the definitive adaptation of the book. (I need to watch the other two entries in the series before I say the same about those.) if you are among the 12% percent of movie goers who haven’t seen it, give it a try.",8.0

 <em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'</em> is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.
 
 I love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.
 
 The cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.
 
 Away from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.
 
 The look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.

 Based on the fantasy world written by Tolkien, we see the halfling hobbits, the most unlikely of heroes, a breed of human type beings who indulge in pleasures, games, and fun, and do little evil.
 In the same world are more powerful beings, some good, like the elves and wizards, some evil, like the orcs, trolls, and dragons, and some in between, like the dwarves and men.
 And one evil super being, Sauron, the second in command to the ""devil"" of this world called Middle Earth, and that devil called Melkor is now in chains and powerless, so Sauron rules all evil.
 That said, we get a very faithful version to the book, only improved. This is the first of three segments called ""The Lord of the Rings"". The parts left out are parts best left out. Tom Bombadil, for example, along with his wife, represents a very Hitler like Aryan ideology of supremacy that Tolkien often engaged in. 
 The film begins with a narrative and action sequence that is awesome, and then goes into the ""status quo"" setting of the ""shire"" of hobbits, much like the status quo setting of films like ""Women of Dolwyn"".

You can only wonder at the sheer imagination of JRR Tolkien and of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens as they adeptly adapt this epic tale of power for a new generation. Certainly, it over-hams the accents - maybe just a few too many ""rrrs"" in ""Arrragorrrrn"" but otherwise it's a feast for senses. When the hairy-footed Hobbit ""Bilbo"" (Sir Ian Holm) gets to eleventy-one he sets off to write his life-story with the elves. He leaves his possessions - including a mysterious ring - to Frodo (Elijah Wood). When visiting wizard ""Gandalf"" (Sir Ian McKellen) identifies it as the epitome of wickedness that puts all of their lives are in danger, ""Frodo"" and his lifelong friend ""Sam"" (Sean Astin) must flee their bucolic happiness. This first instalment of the trilogy tracks the journey of the hobbits as they meet ""Stryder"" (Viggo Mortensen) and together try to evade the pursuing wraith attempting to get to ""Elrond"" the Elvish king in ""Rivendell"" and decide what is best to do with this evil, seemingly indestructible talisman. Their only solution proves to be returning the ring to the lava-filled cavern of ""Mount Doom"" where it was forged: only there can it's corruption be defeated. The brave hobbits, together with two men, an elf and a dwarf set out to accomplish this all but impossible task fighting the weather, evil orcs, malevolent magic and the harsh terrain on their treacherous way. It's the ultimate fantasy adventure; that sticks to the spirit, if not to every word, of the original work. The effects both in make-up and from the computer are expertly applied creating a real sense of tension and peril that compliments, rather than subsumes, the actual action and beautiful cinematography of the New Zealand scenery through which our intrepid gang must travel. This is probably the weakest of the three episodes as it takes a good hour to get going; but once it does and the ""Fellowship"" takes firmer form with a superb John Howard-Davies; a handsome Orlando Bloom and even the usually wooden Sean Bean raises his game to give us as a truly cracking, at times quite scary adventure that is magnificently scored by the inspired Howard Shore. This is not really a film that works on the telly - however large the screen may be. To do justice to the creativity of all concerned it just has to be given the respect it deserves and be seen in the cinema. If you get a chance, you should go see it (again!).",8.0
120,67f32ffaa5471a51ee99416a,AshenArcanist,"One Trilogy to rule them all. Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Ring, the start of this epic journey, remains unmatched in its reverence for Tolkien’s work – not merely as an epic tale, but as a moral and mythological construct with its own internal gravity. Unlike many contemporary fantasy productions, which often treat Tolkien’s world as a loose template to be re-skinned, Jackson’s film operates as a careful translation, not a reinvention. Every creative decision, from script to score to set design, reflects an understanding that Middle-earth is not a playground, but a legendarium – a world with its own laws, languages, and deeply rooted cosmology. It is this sense of literary responsibility that makes Fellowship not just a good adaptation, but a great one.
 
 Too many modern shows, even those cloaked in Tolkien’s vocabulary, feel less like adaptations and more like speculative reinterpretations – injecting modern anxieties and tropes into a narrative that was already rich in timeless concerns. Where those newer productions often flatten the moral contours of the story into grey ambiguity or impulsive spectacle, Jackson’s Fellowship preserves the text’s theological seriousness and philosophical clarity. It understands, crucially, that Tolkien was not writing about swords and sorcery, but about humility, sacrifice, and the perilous allure of domination. The Ring is not a mere object of power – it is a spiritual test – and the film never lets us forget it.
 
 The performances reflect this deeper understanding. Ian McKellen’s Gandalf is not a stock wizard, but a being of deep time, burdened by knowledge and reluctant authority. Elijah Wood’s Frodo captures the very soul of Tolkien’s hobbit – a creature of small stature and immense will, shouldering a task no one would envy. Sean Astin’s Samwise is played not for comic relief, but as a paragon of unsung virtue: loyalty without ambition, courage without ego. Viggo Mortensen’s Aragorn is a man wrestling with history, shaped by the burden of lineage, not the thrill of it. These portrayals are not just emotionally effective; they are textually faithful.
 
 Cate Blanchett’s Galadriel deserves special mention. Her portrayal embodies the strange, luminous power of the Elves as Tolkien wrote them – otherworldly and terrible in equal measure. Her temptation scene is delivered with haunting restraint, the grandeur of her voice a vessel for ancient sorrow and quiet wisdom. This Galadriel is not a warrior queen in the modern sense, but a bearer of deep time, whose greatness lies in her refusal to grasp at power. It is a performance that understands the Elvish condition: to be fading, beautiful, and bound to a world no longer theirs. Blanchett’s screen time is brief, but the echo of her presence lingers – like Elven light in dark places.
 
 Jackson’s adaptation respects Tolkien’s languages and mythic structures with near-obsessive care. Elvish is not set dressing; it is spoken with phonetic integrity, tied to cultures that feel ancient and real. The geography, costumes, architecture – each bears the mark of deep lore, not just visual flair. Howard Shore’s score, informed by the same gravitas, does not accompany the film so much as inhabit it. His themes are not just musical motifs but narrative threads, echoing the rise and fall of kingdoms and the quiet dignity of small acts of heroism.
 What distinguishes The Fellowship of the Ring is that it treats Tolkien’s world as something already complete – something to be entered humbly, not reshaped. In doing so, it achieves a rare artistic feat: it becomes an extension of the text, not a commentary on it. While newer works may borrow Tolkien’s lexicon and aesthetics, Jackson’s film believes in his world. It does not merely entertain; it partakes in a mythology. That belief, that reverence, is what endures.",9.0

 https://www.msbreviews.com
 
 After years of outstanding effort from passionate fans, Warner Bros. finally decided to give Zack Snyder the opportunity to finish his movie on his own terms. 2017's Justice League went through massive production issues - explained in my review of said film - and despite years of extremely tiresome, toxic discourse on social media, the famous Snyder Cut got a controversy-inducing budget to complete an undoubtedly unfinished cut. A crucial disclaimer: you'll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches. Some people will review it as a standalone, regular movie, while others will look at it as an extended/alternate cut of a film previously released. I'm part of the latter group of reviewers.
 
 I find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything Snyder had in his hand. Director/Extended/Ultimate Cut, call it what you feel it's appropriate, but it's a four-hour movie, so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant. The narrative is fundamentally the same, which means the audience knows what's coming from a general perspective. Still, I'm reviewing this version mostly on its own merits, but without forgetting that it's not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released.
 
 Without getting into spoilers, I do have to write this: the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading, and I don't doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters. The whole ""it's a totally distinct movie"" or ""Joss Whedon only used 10% of Snyder's footage"" were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didn't need it. Out of the 119 minutes of the 2017's version, probably around 80/90 minutes are also in the Snyder Cut, which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique. The base of the narrative is identical, most scenes are just extended versions of the original, but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make Zack Snyder's Justice League better than its ""predecessor"".
 
 The most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about Cyborg. Ray Fisher's character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie. From his backstory to the development across the runtime, Cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut, leaving as a complete, compelling character who I genuinely cared for. On the other hand, Aquaman and The Flash receive similar introductory scenes with Batman, barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences. However, once the League is assembled, the character interactions increase, improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the ""Us United"" storyline.
 
 The humor and tone remain lighter than in other Snyder films, clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version (Whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut). The intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing, but the longer build-ups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent. Compared to the original's abrupt, awful editing work, the Snyder Cut has a tremendously better flow, giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other. I rather watch an overlong film with a well-built story than the complete contrary. Some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movie's consistency.
 
 Story-wise, besides the fantastic arc given to Cyborg, there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline, but when it comes to the main narrative, it's more or less about the same. Every action sequence with pre-existent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before, but the new VFX are as hit-and-miss as Junkie XL's score. The latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing. While some scenes get an absolutely perfect, epic soundtrack, others receive weird, out-of-place music distracting the scene itself.
 
 There's only one change I definitely dislike: the R rating brings horribly artificial, forced blood splashes and out-of-nowhere cursing that simply don't belong in the film. I know Snyder loves his gritty, bloody, gory action - as do I - but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action, or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film. A few bloody sequences work well enough, but most just feel notably forced, while the cursing feels ridiculously out-of-character at points. It's by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut, but admittedly, one that doesn't heavily impact my opinion.
 
 A common issue I have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove. Snyder Cut partially breaks that rule, removing some scenes from the 2017's version, supposedly only Whedon's footage (which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie). While most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient, there's a couple of them that not only don't improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film. For example, in Snyder Cut, the ""bringing Superman back"" arc lacks an important character's take on the situation, having in mind that character's past. It actually feels a bit out-of-character that the viewers don't get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action.
 
 Regarding Steppenwolf, his design looks better than the terrible original, and his motivations are clearer, but unfortunately, he remains a generic CGI punching bag for our superheroes. His dynamic armor is packed with spikes, but it's really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle. I can't get into spoilers about Darkseid or DeSaad, but I can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fan-service, just like Joker (Jared Leto). The ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new/extended action scenes, and it does play out differently - though the conclusion is essentially the same - leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon.
 
 Zack Snyder's Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017's version. As expected, its four-hour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary, irrelevant scenes, but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly non-theatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose. Despite most of the original Justice League being present in the Snyder Cut - something that might surprise a few fans - the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition. Cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio did. The extended action sequences are more riveting, and pre-existent footage is definitely improved, but the new VFX are as erratic as Junkie XL's all-over-the-place score. The R-rating is the only straight-up negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced, fake-looking blood and rare yet cringe-worthy cursing. Highly anticipated characters and/or storylines are better described as unimpactful fan-service, but overall, most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built. In the end, I sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled, and I hope that the DCEU continues with Snyder involved - just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions.

791373,6053c31042f19f003c9945cd,JPV852,"Definitely an improvement over the Whedon version and as a DC fan, enjoyed plenty of the character moments (and the addition of MM) but the story did feel off even though the film is nearly four hours long, in addition the alternate timeline part at the end felt tacked on and unnecessary. The visual effects looked like something from a video game but I can forgive that since I'd imagine it'd cost an additional $100M to make it look cleaner and more realistic.
 
 Given what Snyder had to work with and the fact in reality the studio should've been patient and given him and his family to mourn and re-group later, I am glad this did become a reality, shame that outside of maybe The Flash movie there won't be a follow-up with Darkseid. **3.5/5**",7.0
791373,6055862bfd4f800074b8e18f,sykobanana,"This is DC's best so far...easily.  
 Although not flawless- there are a couple of scenes that didnt need to be included - this is the version that we needed to see.  
 There is so much more time given to the characters in this, the plot is better thought out and structured, and Steppenwolf is no longer a joke.  There is actually an urgency in his battles with the JL now.  And OMG, Darkseid and Desaad look and sound boss.  
 The recruitment is harder, the fight between the JL and Supes and then the JL and Steppenwolf is more brutal, and Superman's 'recovery' is better paced and makes more sense. 
 This also follows directly on from BVS and links directly into Aquaman. 
 And the closing cover of Hallelujah is glorious (it near comes close to Jeff Buckley's angelic version)
 
 It's flaws - Timing of release - I need to watch this in a cinema.  FU WB for not giving Snyder the time to finish this as he envisioned.  THIS is what we should have gotten, not the tripe that was Josstice League.  This movie shows that Snyder was not just trying to catch up to Marvel, he was their own version of their stories and it should have been allowed to come to the end of the cycle.  
 Also, I was underwhelmed by the score and would have loved Zimmer to have returned to complete this.  
 And there are a couple of initial set-up scenes that could have been let go or shortened and the gapping continuity error scene in the middle where the JL get introduced to Alfred after theyve already met him should have just been left out. 
 
 But we got what we asked for - the Snyder Cut in its entirety. 
 And I am grateful for that...thankyou.
 
 Now, could we please create ZSJL2 so we can see the Injustice and Darkseid stories.",9.0
791373,6055d0169ae613006adfb910,Peter89Spencer,"I really, really REALLY wasn't expecting this - it felt like the extended edition of Lord of the Rings, if Zack Snyder directed it!
 No, this was Zack Snyder's vision of Justice which we should've seen, if it wasn't for Joss Whedon hadn't pissed all over it. I mean, I understand why Snyder had to pull out the production, I really do, but Whedon could've had the decency to keep to heart on Snyder's work. Looking back, it was a total disrespect to the visionary director. This film...wow! It was truly and 100% amazed me.
 
 Plus, my best highlight was the voiceover of of Superman's dads Johnathan and Jor-El reminding him of who is he - it felt poignant.
 
 That said, a couple of things I feel I must complain about this, just small things; 1) I noticed Mera had a change of accent. Probably an original idea, but it sounded funny especially soon after 2018 Aquaman was released. 2) Victor Stone's dad Silas sacrificed himself - not only was it upsetting but it changes everything for the future of DCEU films. I guess this means they;ll have to rewrite everything for that Cyborg movie!
 
 At least we got the introduction of the Joker (Jared Leto reprising his role) as well as the (not so) surprising twist of the Martian Manhunter!
 Not to mention we finally got to see the appearance of Darkseid - it was all like a fusion of 300's Persian empire and LOTR's Sauron!
 
 In the end, this was a true masterpiece from Zack Snyder, since Watchmen and Sucker Punch, and I am so pleased - no, grateful this was made. I thank not just the director himself for returning to this project but also the many fans who petitioned this director's cut to happen.
 For once, we finally had something good out of all this chaos that was covid 19, hence why they chose the song Hallelujah for their Snyder cut trailer!

791373,60742314d4b9d900792149d9,iselates,"I don't understand why people are getting so horned up over this movie. It's got the exact same plot as the theatrical cut, but it's longer and more drawn out with unnecessary slow-motion and scenes that any editor worth their salt would have cut out (like Aquaman's Icelandic singers). And what we're left with?
 
 Darkseid gets his ass kicked and then forgets he was ever on Earth. Hardly anything spectacular.
 
 Steppenwolf's armor now looks like something designed by early 90s Rob Liefeld, which is not at all a compliment.
 
 The Cyborg stuff was pretty good for the most part, although the sequence with the single mother was just as pointless as Whedon's Russian family and there was absolutely no logical reason why his father had to sacrifice himself. But Snyder is a fan of fathers sacrificing themselves when there is absolutely no logical reason for it (see Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel).
 
 So what else is there?
 
 ""Superman wears the black suit!""
 
 Okay...and...? It's just a black version of his usual suit, there's no story reason why he wears it, and it looks like Snyder intended for him to keep on wearing it. Which is stupid and doesn't fit that character at all. And amusingly enough, I see some of the people freaking out about this who in the 90s would have lost their shit if Tim Burton's black-suited Superman movie ever got made.
 
 We also have Wonder Woman splattering bad guy brains over walls and vaporizing people RIGHT IN FRONT OF LITTLE KIDS! And once Steppenwolf is clearly defeated, Superman heat visions off part of his head FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON OTHER THAN CRUELTY! 
 
 This is what people are all pumped up for? To see Superman and Wonder Woman go all Abu Ghraib on people?
 
 Oh, and we get the Martian Manhunter. Who clearly knows everything that's happening, BUT DOESN'T LIFT A GODDAMN FINGER TO HELP OUT! Martian Manhunter, it should be added, IS ABOUT AS POWERFUL AS SUPERMAN! But does he turn up at the Batcave to say, ""You could probably use my help""? No, he just hangs back, impersonates Martha Kent, and then only shows up to offer his help AFTER THE THREAT HAS BEEN DEFEATED! Gee, J'onn, maybe we could have used you back when Steppenwolf WAS FLAT-OUT MURDERING PEOPLE! This movie takes one of the greatest Justice Leaguers of all, a character who has always been a model of selflessness, and turns him into a coward who sits on the sidelines.
 
 And then of course we get the Knightmare sequence, where we get to be subjected once more to Jared Leto's absolutely godawful Joker performance, Batman drops an F-bomb because idiot fanboys with the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old think that's ""badass,"" and Snyder basically riles up his little cult so they can start harassing people about #RestoreTheSnyderverse.

791373,607b8f6cab68490058bec703,StoneCrow1977,"Admittedly, I don’t know as much about DC as I do about Marvel. However, I’m fairly well versed in them and the Justice League is my favorite DC team. When it was announced that DC would come out with a Justice League movie after the Avengers, I had hope...that is until I learned that they’d be doing a team movie first and individual movies afterward. This is the exact opposite of what Marvel did.
 
 During the production of the first movie, Zack Snyder had the incredibly unfortunate disposition of learning that his daughter had committed suicide. Understandably, he took a break from the movie. Because Warner executives don’t understand anything, they went on with the production.
 
 Hiring Joss Whedon to finish the production, the final product was lackluster at best. In typical Zack Snyder style, it was more flash than substance. After it came out, Zack went public and said that the movie was nowhere near his final vision. Not long after this, the hashtag #releasethesnydercut was trending on Twitter. Four years later, the director’s cut was completed and we got a monstrosity of a movie. Now the true question is “Was this movie worth the hype?”
 
 Honestly...not really.
 
 Now I write this from the point of view of one who’s been a comic book fan for 32 years. Also realize that there are MANY stories that I haven’t read and equally as many storylines that I’m ignorant to. However, I understand the characters. I’m a firm believer that character develops story. George Lucas said: “A Special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.” This is a lesson that Zack Snyder has never learned. Now, Joss Whedon gave us an amazing movie with The Avengers - and that’s the only comparison that I’ll make - so it’s possible that WB wanted some of that lightning in a bottle for JL and that’s why they brought him on.
 
 When Ray Fisher went public and said that Joss created a hostile work environment (as well as one of the producers), the way it was presented was that he didn’t get things that he wanted, so he’d complain. I’m glad to admit that I was wrong in that assumption. Ray actually opened the floodgates against Joss and it turns out that he’s not a good person - he’s a great writer and filmmaker, but that doesn’t make up for his behavior. This is relevant (and the last time I’ll mention it) because a good portion of this movie has Cyborg in it. The majority of his scenes were heavily cut from the first movie. Like 90% majority.
 
 I appreciate Zack wanting his vision to get out - every director has the right to tell a story the way they want to - but I wish that he’d step away from the writing process. He’s a great filmmaker but not a great storyteller. He needs a writer that has synergy with him.
 
 That being said, the special effects are very well done, although I REALLY wish the comics would have been honored better. Simple things like the way the Boom Tubes were portrayed would have been great fan service. Also, the boxes are FATHER Boxes. A Mother Box is a little bit larger than a cellphone. Father Boxes are used for evil on Apokolips and the Mother Box is used for good on New Genesis. If a feministic agenda caused that change, then I disagree with the studio’s decision and a quick 15-second explanation (like what I just did) would have solved that problem and added more to the plot (all the while giving a nod to the New Gods). Yes, I’m critical but it’s important.
 
 My favorite of the cast is Gal Gadot. She captures the essence of Wonder Woman perfectly. I also like Ben Affleck as Batman - I’ve always supported him in the role and he does a really good job with it. In fact, he’s second only to MIchael Keaton.
 Now this is where I’m probably going to get a lot of hate, so if if happens...bring it on…
 
 EVERYONE else in the cast I hate. EVERYONE.
 
 Ezra Miller is easily the worst Barry Allen ever. He’s supposed to be Barry, but he acts like an immature Wally. Absolutely terrible.
 
 I HATE Henry Cavill as Superman. He’s bottom of the list for me. I think Man Of Steel sealed that opinion for me, but he’s just terrible. His suit in this was sharp, so I’ll give credit where it’s due.
 
 Ray Fisher actually didn’t do a terrible job as Cyborg, but I’d never put Cyborg in the Justice League. If they wanted a robot-type character, they could have easily used Red Tornado.
 Jason Momoa is just awful. He’s not Aquaman. I don’t care that he doesn’t have blond hair. He doesn’t fit the role. It would have been much better if he was cast as Lobo. He’s a much better fit there.
 
 We also get a brief cameo by another Justice Leaguer that was a wasted opportunity but sets up a sequel that will probably never happen.
 
 I understand that Zack likes big spectacular shots in his movies. I understand that he wants these heroes to be larger than life. However, his style is very arthouse - there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. There’s quite a few superheroes that would benefit from that style of filmmaking. These aren’t those superheroes. Zack needs to understand that many times less is more.
 
 Ultimately, this movie is an anomaly. It’s an improvement on the first movie, but it’s not better. It tried to do so much, but had the individual hero movies come out first, there would have been so much more to the story. Instead, everything is crammed into this four hour long beast that doesn’t accomplish as much as it wanted.
 
 Because of the improvements, and only because of the improvements I can only give this a 3 out of 5.",6.0

791373,62cedae2b9744203ba6b459b,Nathan,"_Zack Snyder's Justice League_ is able to turn one of the worst superhero movies of all time into a fantastic film filled with great action, heart, and depth.
 
 The original 2017 _Justice League_ cut was unbearable to watch, each line of dialogue felt out of place and extremely corny. I was physically cringing at almost every scene. These problems are completely wiped away in the Snyder Cut allowing for a more character focused and emotional telling of the dawn of the Justice League. The entire film is completely different, with scenes completely cut and the order adjusted to have a more organic viewing experience.
 
 With a runtime of four hours, I was really nervous of feeling bored or the movie having a large amount of filler to pad the runtime, but that is not the case. Each scene is crafted perfectly to deliver important character depth, allowing the viewer to gain an emotional connection with each of our heroes. Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman all have very fleshed out introductions, giving the audience a glimpse of their motivations and struggles living in a world with their powers. Cyborg has a tremendous arc with his struggling relationship with his father, which gets great pay off in the end of the film. The Flash feels grounded too with his motivation for fighting crime to help prove his father's innocence. With this new perspective and tone, his quips feel more like that of an immature kid (much like Spider-Man) rather than infused comedy that was forced by the corporate overlords.
 
 Batman and Wonder Woman are great in this film, with each giving arguably their best performance as their respective characters. Batman feels like a man who has truly learned from his past mistakes and wants to gather and lead his team rather than divide. Wonder Woman is a confident bad-ass Amazon who's heartfelt and understanding presence is the glue that holds the team together. Aquaman does not have all that much of an arc in this film but has a great lead into his solo movie which is noteworthy.
 
 Not only are the hero's more fleshed out but so are the villains. Steppenwolf has an actual motivation that the audience can sympathize with and understand. This leads him to feel more genuine in his conquest to take over the world. Steppenwolf plays really well with the backdrop of Darkseid who is looming in the background of every scene of our villain. It really creates a relationship akin to the Emperor and Darth Vader. The introduction of the life equation adds much more stakes and an emphasis on what the conquest is actually about.
 
 The action in this movie is great. The R rating added more room for the scenes to be more brutal and visceral with blood and gore, and even a beheading! While the majority of the film had pretty decent CGI, there were a few scenes that looked really out of place. Especially the ones with Darkseid and his lackies, which reminded me of a character straight out of a PS2 game. This largely had to do with the limited budget and time constraints the Synder Cut was given.
 This film delivers on Zach Snyder's vision of Justice League, and I am so happy it exists. Although it also brings a sense of sadness as well, because the movie sets up for so much potential for the DCEU and now that future has all but vanished.

It was good seeing Wonder Woman move fast ... However Zack musta not known that she CAN fly now thanks to WW84. I was annoyed half the time by Ezra's portrayal of Barry Allen ... But impressed with Cyborg being so much more in depth. For all the hype of DarkSeid ... He fell flat for me... And Steppenwolf was hard to look at sometimes... Being too much CGI. I love seeing the battles with Amazons, Atlantians, and Men vs DarkSeid. I hated Amber Heard period. All that teasing of the Joker for a small 5 minute nightmare scene with Batman being a total jerk was a little let down but Jared Leto played it so perfectly it made me want MORE. Martian Manhunter... I was so happy to see him. So much potential for so much more that could have been done but WB is being Aholes and not letting Zack continue. I love the movie...

This is not a bad strategy. An hour at a time of this gargantuan abomination is more than any thinking person can bear. ZSJL reminds me of Ambrose Bierce's famous book review; “The covers of this book are too far apart.” It doesn't help either that half the movie seems to occur in slow motion.
 
 Superman's quote-unquote death has resulted in the reactivation of the “Mother Boxes” and the appearance of Darkseid's servant Steppenwolf on Earth. Steppenwolf hails from Apokolips, a planet that exists on a different plane of existence from the regular DC Universe, in spite of which he speaks perfect English, and his name is a German word for an animal presumably found only on Earth.
 
 Steppenwolf retrieves a Mother Box from Themyscira, following a battle of incredible proportions – not because it involves mythological beings and alien deities, but because the world of the Amazons is almost entirely computer generated, its scenery only slightly more sophisticated than an Age of Empires screenshot.
 
 How can this movie ask us to believe in a place like Themyscira, when the film itself doesn't seem to have much faith in its existence? This is symptomatic of ZSJL, much of which takes place in a setting completely divorced from the real world – and my complaint is not that it's unrealistic, because ZSJL is fantasy after all; my problem is that it's not real. I mean, it's just not there.
 
 Other than as childhood wish fulfillment, true-blue superheroes are very hard – sometimes even impossible, as with the immortal, omnipotent Superman – to identify with or care about; their physical and moral perfection renders them boring and predictable. ZSJL makes it even harder by placing them in front of green/blue screens most of the time, constantly surrounded by wall-to-wall CGI, and unconvincingly engaging enemies who are literally an afterthought – digitally added in post-production, and very poorly at that.
 
 And speaking of characters that are nothing short of caricatures, there’s Flash (Ezra Miller). Barry Allen is annoying, irritating, obnoxious, insufferable, grating. He's like a very fast Jar Jar Binks. He's like the bastard son of Andy Dick and French Stewart. If he's so quick, why does it take him so long to get off my screen?
 
 All things considered, there's nothing here we haven't seen in Avengers. Darkseid is Thanos, the Mother Boxes are the Infinity Stones, Batman is Ironman, etc., etc. The one difference is that Zack Snyder's Justice League is, though I would not have thought it possible, longer and more boring than any Marvel movie. The only thing that alleviates the overwhelming oppressiveness are the brief interventions of Willem Dafoe and Jeremy Irons, whose considerable talents are wasted on this debacle.",1.0

 And it didn't end with that horrible over-dramatic race between Superman and Batman to save more people.
 
 And it had more of a plot.
 
 So, in the end it's jut a much better movie than the steaming pile that was released...
 
 ... but you're not supposed to like it because Twitter, Hollywood, the left in general and the media that supports it have all come to the conclusion that fans are evil for being fan.  And making a movie that the fans want makes you evil.  And the goal is to make movies the fans don't want to see, lose money on it, get praise by critics and lots of Twitter Twits, and then blame the fans for not watching a movie that you didn't make for the fans and made widely announced that you didn't make it.
 
 But the fans demanded this, they wanted to see it, the demand caused the studio to release it, and when they did the fans came out to watch it and liked it.
 
 So, despite it being far better than the original (and far too long) you are supposed to hate it because of politics... even though there are no politics in the plot.
 
 And then there is the fact that it the first release only sucked because of heavy studio interference, and so you can't celebrate as a studio being smart enough to go back and make it better for the franchise, you have to condemn it because the studio can't overcome, because that would be admitting a mistake.
 
 You have to hate it, even thought it was pretty good and fantastic compared to the first attempt.

414906,621d02856b5fc2006b954bab,garethmb,"“The Batman” Is A Very Engaging And Unforgettable Tale That Is One Of The Best Adaptations Of The Character Ever
 
 In 1989 Michael Keaton was seen as a very controversial choice to wear the Cowl of Batman but soon proved his doubters wrong by turning “Batman” and its subsequent sequel “Batman Returns” into massive Box Office success before leaving the cape behind.
 
 While four other actors have taken up the cinematic version of the character in the subsequent years, Keaton has remained for many the Gold Standard with Christian Bale likely being his biggest rival.
 
 When Robert Pattinson was named as the new Batman, there was interest but concern as an actor who is largely known for playing Edward in the “Twilight” films seemed to be an odd choice. However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in “The Lighthouse” would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.
 
 In “The Batman”, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.
 
 When the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as “The Riddler” (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as “The Batman” is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.
 
 Further complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.
 
 As the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.
 
 As the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.
 
 The film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.
 
 The dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film’s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.
 
 Pattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.
 
 Pattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.
 
 The strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.
 
 Director Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.
 
 I found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.
 
 The film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, “The Batman” was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.

 Greig Fraser's cinematography - bone-chilling ""ins-and-outs"" of Batman and stunning footage of Gotham - and Michael Giacchino's score - genuinely addictive, elevates the entire film - make this adaptation the best-looking and best-scored cinematic version of the Batman ever.
 
 Even with the narrative focus on the detective work, the action sequences are exhilarating and beautifully shot. The entire cast is extraordinary, especially Paul Dano and Robert Pattinson - the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent.
 
 Apart from a short period at the end of the second act, the three hours fly by. It's one of the best movies of the year and a fair contender in the debate of best comic book movie of all-time.""

414906,62241381b84f940045446a10,Chris Sawin,"Paul Dano and Colin Farrell are extraordinary, but _The Batman_ is a three hour slog through Gotham that culminates with an over exaggerated riddle that isn’t worth solving. Having Batman and Jim Gordon both speak in raspy, whispery grunts feels excessive as does Gordon’s insistence on calling Batman, “Chief,” every time that they’re together. The film deserves credit for prominently shining the spotlight on the underbelly of crime in Gotham, but the storytelling in _The Batman_ is a lot like Bugs Bunny meaning to have taken that left turn at Albuquerque; a meandering foray down a dark rabbit hole that isn’t entirely necessary.

 Ever since it was announced that Matt Reeves was going to direct The Batman after Ben Affleck stepped down for personal reasons, I had no doubt he was going to put on one hell of a masterpiece. This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.
 
 Robert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn't need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zoë Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce's emotional support during Dark times.
 
 The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman's iconic score. Matt Reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around Batman.
 
 Overall, a God-Tier Batman movie that I can't wait for the Cinematic Universe that's being made around it as I type this.",10.0

 Matt Reeves did a great job with 2022's <em>'The Batman'</em>. It's difficult not to compare this to other Batman films, though that's DC/Warner Bros. fault for featuring him so much in recent times. I'll get this out the way early: I'd say <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-begins/"" rel=""nofollow"">Batman Begins</a>'</em>/'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-knight/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Dark Knight</a>'</em> are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.
 
 Robert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zoë Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I've seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit 'meh' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won't say as who, but I don't hold high hopes for him in that role; though, <a href=""https://variety.com/2022/film/news/the-batman-ending-joker-barry-keoghan-matt-reeves-1235196812/#:~:text=While%20it%20may,more%20%E2%80%9CBatman%E2%80%9D%20movies."" rel=""nofollow"">apparently</a> it won't be anything that happens anyway. For the best!
 
 Anyway... the above sounds <em>way</em> too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It's a film that I'd consider as 'outstanding'.
 
 It'll be cool to see what Reeves does with this trilogy (should it happen, of course).",9.0
414906,624085464cbe12005d584bd9,Tatsky,"I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of ""vengeance"" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.
 
 It's interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this ""badass"" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it's portrayed is frightening to everyone. It's a better criticism of Batman's fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don't even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.
 
 Honestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They're inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.
 
 There are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It's weird how it goes between ""it's the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs"" to ""it's just bad apples"" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne's criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn't undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could've done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her ""eat the rich"" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it's OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.
 
 Also the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman's controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they're both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.
 
 The end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could've been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn't stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that note
 Although speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film. 
 
 The aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce's obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. Lovely
 
 The music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn't quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman's motif? Amazing.
 
 The performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don't hate him. He's well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.
 
 Yep, this is my fav Batman film now.",8.0
414906,62473bdefd6fa1004e5031e7,aquiluus,"This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.
 
 There's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.
 
 Being a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.
 
 Bringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely. Can't wait to see more of this universe.",10.0

Forget screenplay, it's a comic storyboard; Do you remember Rorschach, from Moore's Watchmen, ruminating in the sewers?, ok, transpolate Batman and it works! No way, here I go-monologue and comic dialogues (effective and practical like instant soup, with 2 percent protein), comic narration, that is functional, utilitarian, Bentham would say, with the ellipses and any speech or reasoning that requires 2 minutes of reflection, at most!, """"this whole city´s gonna come apart"" says a District Attorney, scenic cuts and messy complexity...-entertaining but messy-comic, etc, ...it is a comic turned into a movie by someone who - I'm speculating, any resemblance to reality is purely by chance - was advised or made, or made comics in his life, don't you believe me? Ellipsis of all ellipses: ""Alfred, you're not my father ""At 23 minutes of tape, all the conflict of identity and belonging, as well as the purpose of the hero, under the sieve of the most selfish and mean son of millionaires, but let's forget this, let's continue. A Batman beating Kurt's velvety drum Cobain, -didn't tell the subversive c revolutionary adence of Cobain, to think like that I would have to know that grunge swept hardrock -finally in the 90s- and buried Motley Crue, Guns and Roses and others, (yes, I mentioned him, Cobain, and not Nirvana that did not exist, that's why when we die we are left without this specific type of grunge, I already digressed, anyway) but yes, this Batman is doubly omniscient, an ego the size of Gotham City authorizes him (a) not only to -his first omniscience- speaking in the first person of himself when running the plot, that is to say in the events, ""I am revenge"" he says to the subway gang members, (scene that is not better than Todd Phillips' Koker subway, for give another example) that this happened -the first person- almost in all the other versions that precede it,it is also included here -its omniscience, obviously- dominating forensic or medical terms: ""eschimia""? ask Batman of course!, but to (b), his second omniscience, being the narrator of his exploits in the first person, this again leads us to an Alan Moore influence but, with all due respect, as a clericot of Alan's genius Moore. When Batman wants to see the Penguin, he just has to be like the Penguin, appear in the doorway and announce himself, and please, for the fun of the plot, Batman almost spouts a sentence ""please tell me you won't let me in to unfold my money in the form of weapons hidden in my suit, and get in anyway. That is to say, the theatricality and the shadows of the bat, remained in the Babyboomer Generation or Generation X when the entrance was an ""appearance"" through shadows, suspicion and myth. The film is a complex mass because it is as if The Batman, The Batman 2 and 3 had been compressed and I am not only talking about the exhausting time of almost 3 hours, but also because of the number of common threads in which it was woven into a single feature film. For example, the plot increases its complexity first with a Riddler who is an anti-hero, because he indirectly helps Batman and the supposed common good and because of the premises that justify his murders, unmasking the big shots of the underworld at high levels of government, but later, arrested as Edward Nashton, he unmasks himself, that is, he turns himself in, sitting in that cafeteria just when, then yes, we will understand his ""fine"" intentions, and he becomes a true public order villain because he incites the revenge to the uncritical masses and followers of the disorder who have suffered or have resentments for any type of discrimination or corruption that they have suffered in Gotham city, (no more and no less than similar to the end of Todd Phillips' Joker);another complexity is with the cat The cat, I will not say Catwoman, who has her own drama for Kyle and at some point Batman leans on her, to spy on the Prosecutor and at least 2 times saves her from murdering her father Carmine Falcone and the his father's henchman. On the other hand, there is the added density or complexity of transcending and publishing the videos that show that the mother of Bruce Wayne, the mother of Batman had psychiatric problems in Arkham and hospitals and comes from a family that descendants who also had these difficulties and Thomas Wayne , trying to silence the journalist, he used the biggest thug Falcone. In other words, there is a possibility that Falcone, Catwoman's stepfather, is the one who murdered the Waynes that night because Batman's father was about to pity or denounce the next day that he only wanted to silence the journalist and NOT murder him as Falcone did. . In short, it is entertaining but poorly planned for a single feature film due to the enormous amount of detail that is handled.",6.0
414906,624b1ff015a4a1006381e9cc,CinemaSerf,"OK, shoot me now - but you can tell when you are watching a film at the cinema and the audience start to get a bit restless. Well mine did with this overlong, and frankly rather dreary film. The opening few, somewhat dystopian, scenes reminded me of ""Blade Runner"" (1982) and we do hit the ground running. Amidst an hotly contested mayoral election, a chap in a gas mask (""The Riddler"", we learn later) brutally takes out the sitting candidate enticing the ""Batman"" (Robert Pattinson) to come help his policeman pal ""Gordon"" (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate. Seems that the killer wanted that to happen because he leaves our caped crusader a card with a clue. Soon the great and the good of the city are dropping like flies and a web of corruption and deceit at the top echelons of government is emerging. Personally I found this all a bit dull. It flows terribly slowly, and after a while the relentless darkness and a really pretty soporific, moody, effort from Pattinson just started to bore me. There are loads of plot holes - not least just how the ""Riddler"" manages to pull off some pretty heavy duty crimes without having to scale any tall buildings, or sneak past the heavily guarded victims of his spree. The scenes with the completely unprotected DA (Peter Sarsgaard) in a dimly lit street are just plain daft. Colin Farrell is probably my highlight as the duplicitous ""Oz"", and Zoë Kravitz (""Cat Woman”) offers us some decent acrobatics but otherwise, this is an hugely over-rated affair that has a serious paucity of dialogue, is heavily scored and during it's almost three hours, not enough actually happens. Indeed, it is very reluctant to let us leave. I will admit that my first guess at the ending was a bit optimistic, but it could conclude at least another four times before we are finally allowed to stretch our legs. It might look better second time around, but for now it's nothing at all to write home about.",6.0

414906,6263fd340b5fd60f76b801f1,Horseface,"I am so tired of superhero movies. Still, being down with a mild case of Corona, I wanted something to watch that'd go down easy, and The Batman was available, so I picked it.
 
 I have to say that this, to me, is one of the rare superhero movies that appeal to me. And that's after having seen every other Batman movie since Tim Burton's 1989 one. And, I dare say, even with me being fed up with superhero movies, I think this is the best attempt.
 
 At three hours, it feels like binge-watching a three-part miniseries. And by that I mean both that to the extent that it is three acts, they almost perfectly align with an hour each, and also that the pacing is great, and I never got bored.
 
 The cast is excellent. Also, for the first time ever, I'm not thinking that it's ridiculous that no one recognizes Bruce Wayne as Batman. The half-mask actually makes Bruce Wayne unrecognizable. I'm not sure if they thought of that during casting, but it's really quite impressive.
 
 It's also nice to not have to suffer through a pathetic attempt from Batman to make his voice sound cool. Oh dear, Christian Bale trying to look and sound cool was just so cringey. Robert Pattinson is by far the best Batman I've ever seen. The almost depressive mental torment he conveys does not come off as fake or pretension, and that's a first for the Batman franchise as far as I'm concerned.
 
 The mood is bleak without being depressive, the score is fantastic, if a bit too much, the cinematography is amazing, I really have very little to fault here. If anything, it may come off as a little pretentious and self-indulgent, but that's also part of the attraction, and if I'm being completely honest, I think it's more to do with my own ""people need to grow up and stop watching these childish things"" prejudice I have, when in fact the 15-year-old inside of me f...ing loves it, and I need to embrace that childish part of me rather than hate on it.
 
 If there's anything I would change about this movie, it's what I feel is somewhat of a PG-ification of Batman. I would love to see this movie with all its bleak desperation and lust for vengeance on the depravity and evil in the Gotham world, but with a seriously anti-hero, all-violent, bringer-of-death Batman. I would love to see him - in a more crude outfit, with less bells and whistles, and definitely without the cape - destroy, slay and kill, with exploration of the terrible aftermath it would bring, including the impact on his psyche, rather than the beat-up-and-let-go strategy that he is using in this movie. That part just feels to not align with both the doomish mood that sets the story and the seeming existential depression of our masked protagonist. I think that would warrant yet another installment in this franchise. I'm actually surprised how much meat there is on this character.
 
 Also, if the movie overall is consistently a bit too much, the ending takes it one notch further on that scale.
 
 Regardless, I now have two superhero movies that I keep in my movie collection. The other is Watchmen (Director's Cut).
 
 1 star deducted for Catwoman being racist without it being presented as a problem. The casting of her is perfect, by the way. Much better than Michelle Pfeiffer.",7.0
414906,62690f5d38765101658093c5,Peter McGinn,"Oh boy, yet another review here on TMDB about this movie. What is it about comic books that garners so much interest? I am no longer a comic hero fan, either in movies or the source comic books. I have seen some of the Marvel series and the only one that I would watch multiple times if it came across my screen in Ant Man and the Wasp, with its wit, action and humor.
 
 I did read superhero comics as a kid, however. I stuck to DC comics. I especially liked the Legion of Superheroes, though I also read the Justice League, Superman and Batman. This was the Silver Age of comics, I believe, before they restarted and complicated the field with reimagining the comic universe (or whatever it is they did).
 
 Anyway, I was a DC boy so I gave The Batman a look see. It is a dark film, both in its themes and its camera work. No wit and humor to speak of here, just grim and introspective comic book noir. But it was intriguing and interesting enough to hold only my attention. There were a couple of interesting twists on traditional Batman villains, for example. As with a lot of current thrillers, there is quite a body count, when sometimes with violence, I think less can be more.

 It's dark and realistic, but also stylish and large-scale. It's not limited by a commitment to realism like the Dark Knight trilogy, nor is it burdened by a shared universe like the DCEU. It is its own thing. A moody, disturbing, visually stunning, David Fincher-inspired, three hour long detective epic with some of the best interpretations of the characters ever put on screen.
 
 Robert Pattinson is fantastic as a younger, moodier, and yes, more emo Batman. Paul Dano is straight up terrifying as the Riddler. Colin Farrell is unrecognisable in more ways than one as The Penguin and Zoë Kravitz is easily my favorite live-action Catwoman. Massively underrated is john Turturro as Carmine Falcone.
 
 This movie kept me hooked all the way through. It's almost three hours long but it feels like two.
 
 This is the best Batman movie.

Well, this is really personal but, to me, it is not a good Batman movie. I really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. I just did not like it as a Batman movie.
 
 The movie is really dark, gritty and noir. Not really a problem. It works for some movies. But it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. Remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of “boringness”.
 
 The “boringess” was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. Some people seem to not really like the batmobile and I have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. Unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.
 
 The movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of Batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with Batman / Bruce Wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.
 
 Actually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. The choice of actor for the Batman is just wrong for me. He is more like a sad puppy than the Batman. The script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.
 
 To me the Selina Kyle character had more charisma than the Batman, especially when the Batman was in his Bruce Wayne alter ego.
 
 And I really, really dislike that twist about Bruce’s parents. That was such a lazy Hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.
 
 Then we have the Riddler. Compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.
 
 Now, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. The movie is really well done. The detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. Even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better. If it had not been a Batman movie!",4.0
414906,630996ce6e938a007bf1f5fe,tmdb28039023,"The Batman is not a terribly bad movie, but it would be twice as good if it were half as long. How a film that likes to take shortcuts – especially with the Riddler’s ‘riddles’ – can still take almost three hours to get to where it’s going, I haven’t the foggiest (but then this is a rather strange enterprise that gives us Andy Serkis in the flesh and covers Colin Farrell in prosthetic makeup and a fat suit). Director/co-writer Matt Reeves very wisely avoids origin stories and takes for granted relationships, which have already been well established in a decades-long canon, between certain characters; on the other hand, he allows his movie to become bogged down at the halfway point in a deluge of backstory.
 
 The obvious problem is that there is enough material here for at least two films, and Reeves attempts to cram it all into a single one. Why? We all know there are going to be sequels, so why not save some for the next chapter? Or better yet, why not leave some of it on the cutting room floor? There is absolutely no reason for the Penguin to be in this movie; he might as well be the Imperceptible Man (an actual Batman villain, mind you) for all that he’s given to do. Catwoman has been pretty much played out, and as far as the Riddler, I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but Jim Carrey did a much better job with the role than does Paul Dano – an otherwise fine actor that inexplicably chose to play the character as the bastard child of Heath Ledger’s Joker and Tom Hardy’s Bane. That leaves Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who provides the most intriguing plot points; why not make him the main, or even – dare I say it – only villain?
 
 Now, The Batman is long enough to try the patient of a saint, but at least it’s great to look at. Like the first Tim Burton Batman (as described by the unerring Roger Ebert), it “is a triumph of design over story, style over substance - a great-looking movie with a plot you can’t care much about.” Gotham City in particular is a winning combination of Burton’s faux noir texture and Christopher Nolan’s plausible architecture. The best scenes involve Batman (Robert Pattinson) and Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) – and indeed Pattinson has an uncanny knack for playing off veteran character actors – as a sort of pre-Robin dynamic duo; their adventures are poignant because they appear to happen in the real world, or at least as real as a world can be wherein a grown man disguises himself as a giant bat (compare last year’s Zack Snyder's Justice League, with its unending CGI assault on the senses).",5.0
414906,630a77c232489b007b74ba64,Dean,"This was the worst Batman I have ever seen. 
 
 Firstly, Robert Pattinson was the worst choice for the Batman role. In Twilight he was alright, but in Batman he definitely failed. He was more like a sad, depressed goth kid with no emotions. He tried too much to fit the role, but in fact we got this depressive, dead and empty Batman. 
 
 Secondly, there were other small things that sucked about this movie, for example, Cat Woman had a very simple and stupid mask. Even older movie versions had a better mask than here. Batman's batmobile also sucked. Looked like a downgraded version. He also rode just a simple bike and lastly, he couldn't even glide with his default Batman suit. Also, don't know why but James Gordon was played by a black actor, while in every movie and even in every game this character is white. Riddler character also seemed stupid, wearing stupid mask and acting stupid and wasn't intimidating at all, but laughable. So, in general cast and acting was disappointing in this movie.
 
 Lastly, the movie itself... It was dull, boring and depressive. They tried to make it masterpiece with 3 hours long, but in reality movie became just plain boring and I almost fell asleep. 
 
 Overall verdict: Disappointing.",3.0

 ""Mickey 17 presents an intriguing sci-fi concept and raises interesting questions, even if it doesn't always explore them with the desired depth. 
 
 Bong Joon-ho continues to demonstrate his mastery in blending genres, but here, the satire and lack of subtlety in the narrative end up limiting the emotional and philosophical impact of a story centered on sociopolitical themes like identity, technology, and colonialism.
 
 Nevertheless, with a star-studded cast led by an excellent Robert Pattinson and a captivating audiovisual style, the South Korean filmmaker reinforces his status as one of the most creative directors working today, delivering an experience that falls somewhere between fascinatingly hilarious and frustratingly superficial.""

696506,67cbb2be9a3f7013fa4f686c,Brent Marchant,"Some movies have a way of hitting things right on the head, either intentionally or by happy accident. And such is the case in both regards in the latest offering from Oscar-winning writer-director Bong Joon Ho, a hilariously insightful sociopolitical sci-fi satire that knocks it out of the park in more ways than one can count. In an age of casual throw-away culture, “Mickey 17” takes this idea to an entirely new level by following the dubious exploits of the title character (Robert Pattinson), who works as an “expendable,” a human charged with determining just how lethal various new technologies and environmental conditions are in an off-world colony of the future. The ironic, questionable term for this profession is derived from the fact that its practitioners are considered wholly disposable in every sense of the word but are fully capable of being regenerated in full thanks to a form of digital human printing, allowing subsequent iterations of these beings to be created as often as needed. However, life isn’t quite so “simple and straightforward” for the Mickey expendable when he gets caught up in a series of complicated developments involving an illegal double, the whims of the maniacal cultist colony leader (Mark Ruffalo) and his self-absorbed wife (Toni Collette), the scheming of an unreliable, self-serving childhood friend (Steven Yeun), a relentless loan shark (Ian Hanmore) from his days back on Earth, and an aspiring romantic interest (Anamaria Vartolomei) who tries to get between Mickey and his girlfriend (Naomi Ackie), a passionate but badass security officer. The narrative’s various story threads blend well together (even if a few of them are a little stretched out or aren’t developed as fully as they might have been), but they collectively tell a well-integrated tale that generally keeps viewers riveted throughout. This captivating yarn is superbly supported by the picture’s inventive visuals, expert editing. and stellar performances, most notably Ruffalo, Collette, Ackie and the first-ever portrayal by Pattinson that I’ve actually liked. What makes this offering especially and somewhat inadvertently effective, however, is the timing of its release, which was originally scheduled for a year ago but was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, a truly fortuitous blessing in disguise. Given current conditions in today’s turbulent sociopolitical climate, particularly the unpredictable leadership of one particular politician, “Mickey 17” couldn’t have debuted at a more pertinently appropriate time. (While I’ll spare the specifics here, let me just say that MAGA fans and evangelical conservatives probably won’t find this picture much to their liking.) In addition, the film deftly addresses a number of pressing social and cultural themes, such as how the average, everyday working class individual is looked upon and treated these days, the expendability question coming front and center. Some might see these attributes as somewhat heavy-handed or preachy, but then such “excesses” are the essence of good satire, and the filmmaker holds nothing back here. I’m also amazed that all of this was foreseen so far in advance of the emergence of current conditions, decidedly prescient and poignantly relevant in its insights. Indeed, this is genuinely a cinematic fable for our times – a rather scathing one, to be sure, but a damning fable nevertheless. Moreover, if this release is any indication of what 2025’s crop of new pictures will be like, I warmly welcome it given the awful movie year that has just passed. And, where “Mickey 17” is concerned, let’s hope that this all comes to pass – both on the big screen and otherwise.",9.0
696506,67d19682434c98c8ec817313,CinemaSerf,"“Mickey” (Robert Pattinson) is desperate to avoid a grisly fate at the hands of a loan shark, so decides his best bet is to get off-planet. Thing is, there are an whole load of like-minded folk so his only hope is to be an expendable. That means he gets used for all the dangerous and experimental tasks and if he gets killed or seriously maimed, they just lob him in the incinerator and reprint him - complete with all his old and quite a few new memories. Travelling through space, he meets “Nasha” (Naomie Ackie) and they have a good thing going, even if the imperious couple in charge - Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette - have forbidden the wasting of the 100 calories it takes to have sex! Things start to go a bit wrong, though, when he unexpectedly survives one chilly mission only to find upon his return they have already duplicated his successor. “Nasha” thinks the ménage-à-trois thing could work quite well but “Mickey” less so, and when rumours of their duplicate existence starts to abound, well things get distinctly dodgy. Meantime, the indigenous population of the planet they have landed on are getting a bit cross with the murderous attitudes of their human interlopers, and so perhaps it’s gonna be for “Mickey” x 2 and “Nasha” to sort things out before the pitch changes altogether. It’s quite good fun this, but I kept thinking of “Galaxy Quest” and couldn’t decide if Ruffalo was having a go at Donald Trump or Val Kilmer with his rather hammy performance. Also, despite being easy enough on the eye, Pattinson is a remarkably charm-free actor and here, even when there are some daft scenarios and the CGI works flat out to create a perfect series of images, he just underwhelmed the whole time and when the film is about more than one of him, that mattered. Collette and Steven Yeun are relatively under-used and it’s simply far too long to sustain the thinness of a plot that does raise some interesting issues around human cloning, exploration and that especially American cinematic trait of shooting extra-terrestrials first and then asking question later, but I was disappointed with this, sorry.",6.0
696506,67d4c9a30525f3d74f010e5f,r96sk,"<em>'Mickey 17'</em> is a blast! What a fun time at the cinema this was. It delivers a super engaging plot, an excellent cast and some tremendous special effects. I, like almost everyone, love Bong Joon Ho's <em>'Parasite'</em>, but personally I'd rank this one of his higher.
 
 That's likely a personal thing, this is more entertaining and highly likely more rewatchable; that named 2019 flick is quality, but I can't say I've had any inkling to revisit it since I watched it in 2020. Again, just me; it'll obviously vary person-to-person. Two great films, all the same.
 
 Robert Pattinson is brilliant as the titular character, he kills it <i>(ba dum tss)</i> all the way through. Naomi Ackie is as terrific though, she is smashing it in recent years; hard to separate her fantastic performances in <em>'I Wanna Dance with Somebody'</em>, <em>'Blink Twice'</em> and this.
 
 Mark Ruffalo, Toni Collette and Steven Yeun are super in their respective roles too. Top notch casting! Anna Mouglalis voices the leader of the Creepers, who I thought looked outstanding. Awesome effects. The whole look (and sound) of this movie is first-rate. Loved it.",10.0

 I am guilty, as many others will be, of comparing this to Parasite. Doing so is doing the movie a disservice. From Bong Joon Ho I was not expecting a silly black comedy that would have the whole theater laughing. Accept and enjoy it and you'll have a great time.
 
 Although I felt like I was getting slapped in the face with the Trump satire, it still hit pretty well and got a good few laughs out of me.

696506,67f30d4f1bb0472899993c15,MovieGuys,"""Mickey 17"" for those of us, old enough to remember has a Jerry Lewis in space, vibe. 
 
 Mickey's a sad sack, goofy, kind of misfit, who finds himself becoming essentially, a recyclable ""crash test dummy"", in space, to avoid an arguably worse fate, on earth, at the hands of sadistic, loan sharks. 
 
 Simply put, this irritated me from beginning to end. Its not what it needs to be, that is,  genuinely witty and off the wall, likeable. What you get instead, is dark, oftentimes cruel, populated by shabby characters, that are selfish and annoying, in equal measure. If this a species of commentary and, or satire on the human condition, its not a very hopeful one, to say the least.
 
 Acting is only passable, too. The main character's don't stand out and there is nothing to off set their marked limitations. At least, Lewis, who I never liked, had the jovial and engaging, Dean Martin. 
 
 In summary, this is not only not special, its rather bleak, bland and ultimately tedious. It could have been more with upbeat handling and genuine Monty Python-esque humour but that's conspicuous, by its absence. A mediocre watch, at best.",6.0

 For a movie with this much riding it, to come out not feeling disappointed, is a **massive** achievement. While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about _Infinity War_, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.

Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character.

299536,5b3a6dfcc3a36845b800feee,Wuchak,"***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***
 
 RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.
 
 The story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.
 
 This is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is ""Iron Man 2"" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing ""Infinity War,"" as well as ""Black Panther"" (2018) and the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.
 
 ""Infinity War"" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. ""Rabbit."" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel ""Endgame.""
 
 THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.

It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.
 
 The film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.
 
 There are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.
 
 The only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.
 
 A curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.",

Cobb is offered a chance at redemption and a way back to his children through one last job: planting an idea in someone's mind, a process known as inception. This seemingly impossible task involves creating a dream within a dream within a dream, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in both the dream world and filmmaking itself. The intricate plot weaves together elements of heist movies, psychological thrillers, and mind-bending science fiction, creating a narrative tapestry that is as complex as it is captivating.</p>
 
   <h2>Performances and Characters: A Dream Team</h2>
   <p>DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance as the tormented Cobb, haunted by the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). The supporting cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy, bring depth and nuance to their roles, each contributing significantly to the film's emotional core and intricate plot mechanics. Cotillard's portrayal of Mal is particularly noteworthy, embodying both allure and danger as a projection of Cobb's guilt-ridden subconscious. The ensemble cast's chemistry and individual performances elevate the film, grounding its high-concept premise in genuine human emotion and conflict.</p>
 
   <h2>Visual Spectacle and Technical Mastery</h2>
   <p>Nolan's vision is brought to life through stunning cinematography by Wally Pfister and groundbreaking visual effects. The film's most iconic scenes, such as the folding Paris cityscape and the zero-gravity hotel fight, are not merely eye candy but integral parts of the narrative. These visually arresting moments serve to illustrate the malleable nature of the dream world while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in cinema. Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals perfectly, adding layers of tension and emotion to every scene. The technical prowess displayed in ""Inception"" sets a new standard for blockbuster filmmaking, seamlessly blending practical effects with CGI to create a world that feels both fantastical and tangible.</p>
 
   <h2>Legacy and Impact: A Dream That Lingers</h2>
   <p>Since its release, ""Inception"" has sparked countless discussions and debates, particularly regarding its ambiguous ending. This open-ended conclusion invites viewers to question the nature of reality and the power of perception, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll.

 Kevin Williamson, hot off of the success of his screenplay for Wes Craven's Scream, here adapted the Lois Duncan novel with mixed results.
 
 A bunch of pretty teenagers in a coastal fishing town run over a man in the road and try to cover it up. Not a wise move at the best of times, even more so now as the victim, a hook wielding fisherman, is coming to get them.
 
 And that's pretty much it. Williamson adds some humour into the play, while director Jim Gillespie plays his shock tactics well and keeps the pretty young cast annoying enough for us to want to see the fisherman guy enact revenge.
 
 It sadly gets away from itself in the last quarter once the stalker is revealed, and in truth there's very little imagination gone into the whole pic. But it's a decent night in with beer and popcorn for those after a short sharp shock type horror. 6/10",6.0

 Released in 1997, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" takes place in coastal North Carolina where a group of just-graduated teens experience a tragic event and compound it by foolishly reacting. They swear to carry the secret to their graves, but the next summer it becomes clear that someone knows their secret and murders start piling up. The teens are played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. Also on hand are Johnny Galecki, Anne Heche and Muse Watson.
 
 This movie is full of slasher clichés, like the killer who's always in the same garb (this time a fisherman's slicker outfit), the slow-methodical walking of the killer (never running) and the undead dead. There are also two blatant ""Yeah, right"" scenes (noted below). Thankfully, it makes up for it by the stellar coastal locations (strangely shot on BOTH East and West coasts), a quality cast, some effective sequences and the potent moral on haunting guilt that slowly kills ya. The immediate aftermath of the opening accident is particularly well done.
 
 The film runs 99 minutes and shot in Southport, North Carolina, and Jenner, California, and nearby regions of both coasts.
 
 GRADE: B or B- (6.5/10 Stars)
 
 ***SPOILER ALERT*** (DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM)
 
 Here are the two eye-rolling scenes:
 
 1. The sequence where Max's corpse is found in the trunk with the crabs. It couldn't have been an illusion since Helen didn't yet know Max was dead, so it must've really happened. If so, how would the slicker-killer get the trunk cleaned-up so quickly with no one seeing him in a neighborhood in broad daylight? Also, how did he even get into trunk? Did he have his own personal key? The sequence is just too far-fetched.
 
 2. After Barry is murdered by the killer at the pageant how does he know that the cop and Helen would be driving down the alley by-pass an hour or so later? (I realize the street was blocked off and he might've been the one who set it up, but how did he know this would be the precise route taken by the cop and Helen? And how would he even know Helen would be riding with the cop? It's not like she wouldn't have other friends & family in town with whom she could ride. Anyway, wouldn't people living in the downtown area or other passersby notice a man in full-slicker garb working on his truck?
 
 Sequences like these take intelligent viewers right out of the story, which explains Roger Ebert's response: ""After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie than the makers did.""",6.0

3597,66d674534c59aca41db67279,tmdb51616167,"The ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" franchise has left a lasting impact on audiences, with the first film being particularly noteworthy for its thrilling and grounded portrayal of a vengeful antagonist. Ben Willis stands out as a compelling and underrated character, bringing a sense of realism to the story without delving into the supernatural realm. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. deliver captivating performances, drawing viewers in with their charisma and acting prowess.
 
 The sequel, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" takes the characters on a harrowing adventure to an island, adding another layer of suspense and terror to the franchise. While some may overlook this installment as a credible sequel, the addition of Brandy Norwood as Carla contributes to the film's appeal and intensity.
 
 However, the franchise takes a misstep with ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer,"" introducing supernatural elements that detract from the grounded nature of the original films. This departure from reality diminishes the impact of the storyline and characters, leading to a disappointing third installment that lacks the involvement of the main cast.
 
 The television series based on the franchise offers a different but enjoyable take on the story, adding credibility and entertainment value to the overall franchise. While the series was cut short, fans are eager for a reboot that promises to bring fresh energy to the familiar tale. It is hoped that the original cast will return, providing a seamless continuation of the beloved saga akin to the success of the ""Scream"" franchise.",7.0

 <em>'Top Gun: Maverick'</em> is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.
 
 The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.
 
 Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.
 
 Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.

 ""Top Gun: Maverick is the return of pure, nostalgic blockbusters, instantly becoming one of this year's personal favorites. The best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations, not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements.
 
 The surprisingly emotional screenplay helps Tom Cruise deliver one of the best performances of his career. Perfect editing is essential to creating such realism, as well as raising the tension levels for one of the best final acts within the respective genre.
 
 And, finally, the memorable score loaded with epic tracks makes the theater experience the only way this magnificent work should be seen.

 The original movie had some seriousness built into it, the sequel I think is closer to a comic book movie. Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.
 
 I think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit.

The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous ""Top Gun"" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of ""Rooster"" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate ""Goose"" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner ""Penny"" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral ""Kazansky"" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn't really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it's most competitive, but also at it's most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it. Big screen photography - don't wait til it is on the telly.",7.0
361743,6298c0207e12f02c82337cbb,Chris Sawin,"_Top Gun: Maverick_ is a sequel that is a leaps and bounds improvement over the original film. There’s better acting from the entire cast, more of an emotional attachment between at least two of the main characters in the film, and subtle humor that actually lands. But the film’s constant need to fly in the same flight pattern as the original film comes off as more of a restraint than a fond recollection.
 
 The sequel seems to highlight many of the shortcomings of the original film, which in retrospect seems like something you’d try to avoid. With its record breaking box office during Memorial Day weekend, _Top Gun: Maverick_ is an enormously thrilling sequel with unparalleled action sequences that has proven to be exactly what fans have been waiting over 30 years for.

 I never thought, a sequel from 80s hits movie would be exceeding its predecessor. tbh i thought this movie would be suck and will be getting the fate like The Matrix Resurrections and RoboCop remake. But boy i was wrong, this movie is the definition of Awesomeness in Cinema.
 
 Let me start with the Story. This movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one. But is it identical? yes? so it means they just copying it? no. what i mean is Peter Craig did take a few ideas from the first movie for a few scene (i think its a homage for the first movie) but the context has alot more meaning than the first one tbh.
 
 Now Scoring, Lorne Balfe did great job for remaking the Top Gun Anthem... Damn it feels good hearing that theme again... and also, i want to applause Onerepublic and Lady Gaga for creating such an awesome soundtrack for the movie
 
 Now lastly for cinematography and visual effect, its probably the first time in my life i got out from IMAX and said ""i paid 10$ dollar for this movie? i feel like i should've paid more. This movie is too good"". The sound design, the real action from fighter jet, the bloodpumping visual. It all works together creating this masterpiece. its been a decade since i feel this immerse on the movie.

 My main two complaints from the original have been entirely corrected in it's sequel: cheesy dialogue and terrible shot selection in the aerial sequences. The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.
 
 The overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final ""suicide"" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.
 
 The performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.

 That makes sense.  It really does.
 
 Maverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.  It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.
 
 From start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.
 
 So of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern Hollywood.
 
 And that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years.  That is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-COVID.  It's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites.  You're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.
 
 Everything has to be a propaganda piece.  
 
 But you want to know a secret?  If this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well.  It's not as good of an action movie as they had back then.  It actually sort of sucks compared to a lot of the classic action movies of this genre.
 
 But then it came out in 2022 and the rules have all changed.  Today everything is racist or far left.  So what you have here is a movie that is great... by 2022 standards... simply because it's not the crap that Hollywood is shoving down your throats and demanding that you like.",10.0

Like most movies in the past decade or so, real originality is lacking. Seems like all there are nowadays are rehashes of older stuff. The supporting cast is lackluster at best.
 There is nothing in this movie to get excited about. I suppose if you get drunk and need to sleep it off... go watch this movie.",

It fueled my dreams of becoming a pilot, and Tom Cruise's charisma, alongside the adrenaline-pumping aerial sequences, left an indelible mark on my youth. When I heard the familiar theme song for Top Gun, goosebumps erupted across my skin.
 
 While I had sky-high expectations, I confess to feeling a tinge of disappointment. After all, it's been nearly two years since the premiere, and the hype had settled. Yet, I found myself glued to the couch, unable to tear my eyes away. Maverick did its job - it satisfied the old fanboys. The producers flawlessly recreated the vibe of the original, masterfully capturing the essence of that 80s era, but with cutting-edge technology and cinematography. The film is a testament to their meticulous attention to detail.
 
 But Maverick isn't just about nostalgia. For me, it's a celebration of aviation technology. Seeing the F-18 Super Hornet and the iconic F-14 Tomcat, my childhood fighter jet heroes, soar across the screen alongside newer generation aircraft was a joy for my inner tech enthusiast.
 
 While the technical aspects are captivating, the film transcends the niche. Top Gun: Maverick is a universal experience, packed with heart-stopping action, engaging characters, and a compelling story that resonates with anyone who's ever chased a dream. It may not be the groundbreaking masterpiece that the original was, but it's a thrilling and nostalgic journey that will leave you breathless.",

 The movie also stands out as an example for a very good sequel, which might even be superior to the first movie.
 
 If you can see past the blatant and yet relatively sparingly inserted ""US world police"" prop***anda (which was in the first ""Top Gun"" as well), this movie can be a very fun ride for you, especially if you are into a somewhat conservative action movie experience.

 John Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance!

But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick’s story, which disappoints a little.

This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful ""Marquis"" (Bill Skarsgård), who has managed to get those at the ""High Table"" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting ""Winston"" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the ""Marquis"" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for ""Wick"", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar®️ suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2½ hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsgård isn't remotely menacing - like a poor ""James Bond"" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz"" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting ""thwack"" and ""pow"" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored.

 Screenplay: John Wick movies didn't pay much attention to the script, except for the first movie. This movie gave more importance to the script than the last 2 movies. Since the duration is long, they have processed each character beautifully. The script isn't at the forefront, though.
 
 Acting: Actors in the movie have already proven themselves. It was all very good.
 
 Music: It was nice to hear the music from the old movies too. However, there was also new music. Every music was suitable for the stage and very good.
 
 Action: Although there were exaggerated scenes about action, it was better than all the first 3 movies. In particular, there is an action scene shot from the top. That scene is one of the best I've ever seen in the cinema. You enjoy each scene of the action separately. You have trouble sitting in the chair.
 
 Movie Duration: Even though the movie is long, you never notice it. It was a very moving movie.
 
 Overall: This movie is definitely worth watching. It might be the best movie of the series.",10.0

603692,6444c9c705822402fb331ac6,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"I don’t need to tell you that the violent action in “John Wick: Chapter 4” is over the top. If you’re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you’re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren’t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise’s highest body count in its wake.
 
 After being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.
 
 This is Reeves’ movie through and through, and he’s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It’s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsgård) breathes fresh life into the franchise.
 
 The story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you’re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It’s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.
 
 Director Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn’t a film with rapid cutting where you can’t tell what is going on, and it’s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski’s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.
 
 Despite all of the things that are done right, the film’s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.
 
 “John Wick: Chapter 4” is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It’s one rousing, wild ride.

603692,646233a5dbbb420119f5a44d,Nathan,"John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.
 
 One of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.
 
 But perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.
 
 One slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.
 
 Overall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

603692,647028c89672ed01183cd93f,MovieGuys,"The John Wick franchise has now made it to its fourth and maybe final, film. The question is, is it any good?
 
 Simply put, its ""alright"". In much the same way, as its 2019 predecessor, was alright. The script in this kind of exposition driven, action fare does not, typically, change that much. 
 
 A certain amount of creativity and thought, has gone into the stylised, highly choreographed action and violence.
 
 That said, after the first 30 or so minutes of unrelenting gun play/martial art, mash ups, it starts to feeling ""saturating."" 
  
 I can see how the creators have tried to alleviate this feeling of repetition, by offering up differing locations, the use of exotic or special weapons but its simply, not enough. A more evolved story would have helped but regrettably, that was not on offer.
 
 In summary, by no means a poor film but not quite as remarkable, in my estimation, as some reviews would suggest. Still, a decent weekend watch, with your mates over a bag or two of chips and a few beers.",7.0

 Ninehundredmillion (nearly a **billion!** obviously guarantees beautiful pictures - but does that guarantee a profound movie? No!
 
 Since _the Matrix_  Keanu Reeves was established as an action hero - yet he actually never delivered martial arts in a way professionals could relate to him in a way they can to Bruce Lee, Jason Stratham or Jackie Chan (who did perform their own stunts) could. 
 
 Reeves - always somehow clumsy when fighting does kind of ""stagger"" through his shootings and the longer the movie goes on, the more disbelief has to be suspended (like when him shooting 46 shots with one round of 24 shots on the stairs up, where he conveniently kills 26 people). 
 
 How many times he was run over I did not even bother to count, because it starts to become unbelievable by the third time.
 
 Would you consider Reeves to be worth $39.000 for each single word like ""yes"" or ""you"" he uttered ?

 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!! PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!
 
 It's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone’s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.
 
 I was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let’s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain’t just a chapter. It’s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I’m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I’ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.
 
 First of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu’s most consistent and better performances, I would’ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn’t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston’s place as John’s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it’s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I’m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsgård** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn’t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn’t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsgård rises up as this franchise’s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table’s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would’ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.
 
 Now, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn’t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn’t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it’s a huge summer blockbuster).
 
 Where do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I’ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn’t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you’ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn’t skip a beat.
 
 The Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn’t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar. A perfect end to a perfect film.

 The movie follows the story from the previous three movies which of course means a lot of action, ass-kicking and so on and so forth.
 
 Unfortunately this is where the problems starts. The stunts, when it comes to the amount of punishment John Wick can take, is just so far over the top that it is really, well, way too far. I mean, come one, he is thrown from building bouncing on ledges like a bloody rag-doll and just walks away. I would expect some unrealism but this is just ridiculous. It doesn’t help that the bad guys all suddenly shoot like Storm Troopers of course.
 
 Add to that, that the script writers took a note from that lazy slob who don’t give a shit about his fans when it comes to finishing his books and kills off a lot of the likable people on regular intervals.
 
 Then we have the ending. Yes the bad guy got what he deserved and it was a really good scene with a twist, I liked that. But then it continues to the “real” ending. Seriously? After slugging through four films we get that shitty ending?

 **Slow in the first half**",
209112,56f7944bc3a3686a5c005e1d,Frank Ochieng,"One would think that the ultimate showdown between two of the most iconic super-heroes would make for some downright compelling action-oriented exploits against a landscape of angst and destruction. Plus, it certainly did not hurt that exhilarating filmmaker Zack Snyder (‘300’) was at the helm in bringing together the colorfully and concocted confrontation between The Caped Crusader and The Man of Steel. Also, it should have been an effortless task to bring together **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** leading men Ben Affleck and Henry Cahill since they had prior experiences donning heroic attire as mighty super-heroes on call to save the day. So why then does Snyder’s big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless?
 
 The dour randomness of **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** is quite disappointing because this moping actioner wants to grab more than it can chew in its crowded mouth. Snyder and screenwriters David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio aspire to plug in such contemplative issues pertaining to moral ambivalence, political platitudes and religious themes but none of these factors energize or sustain this action-packed narrative that seems to slouch all at the expense of a sluggish approach to the mechanical hedonism that labors.
 
 There is no doubt that **Dawn of Justice** has its share of visual opulence as this is obviously expected in an expansive superhero saga where the proven selling point are two mythical comic book titans spearheading the pumped-up proceedings. Again an overreaching script that plods along, a couple of super-powered sourpusses going the moody motions and the lack of carefree robust action undermine the potential explosiveness that **Dawn of Justice** could have capitalized on with dynamic aplomb.
 
 Sure, there is a noted curiosity and interesting element about the topic of “heroism fatigue” and hidden demons that could have certainly contributed to the psychological strain for our Caped Courageous Ones. Still, **Dawn of Justice** never quite turns this premise into a sparkling case of burn-out conviction, Instead, knuckle-dragging duo of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) and Clark Kent/Superman (Cavell) make the common sleeping pill look like an excitable bag of M&M candy treats. Thankfully, another fan favorite superhero in the form of Wonder Woman (Gal Godot) is thrown into the mix to break up the monotony of the boorish Boys Club. Unfortunately, the appearance of the wily Wonder Woman during the tail end of the second half is too little and too late for her welcomed presence to rescue the film’s clunky pacing.
 
 Gotham’s Bruce Wayne and Metropolis’s Clark Kent are experiencing setbacks that could be perceived as reaching the depressive crossroads. For starters, a maturing Wayne’s/Batman’s crime-fighting prospects have been tailing off drastically. As for Kent/Superman his existence at the Daily Planet newspaper seems mundane especially when his boss in editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) declares that the public has moved away from print given the major impact of social media and other online resources. So yes…Wayne and Kent are in a critical funk in their professional lives both in and out of their familiar costumes. However, can the slumping cities afford two down-and-out superheroes when one can probably carry the load in rough, unsure times?
 
 When the film establishes the dilemma that there can be only one muscle-bound ego to handle the affairs of the region’s unprotected this is where the **Batman v Superman** portion of **Dawn of Justice** looks as if the frenetic fantasy will percolate. Inexplicably, the hype involving the sparring twosome is put on hold as the exposition takes its tedious time building up the conflict to satisfy the clashing insecurities of the capable caped crime-stoppers. For those that witnessed Cavell’s mediocre **Man of Steel** a few years ago will probably understand the current bad blood that exists between the two super studs. Whatever the case both Batman and Superman have pegged each other as brawny bad news ambassadors…something that does not sit well with either struggling superhero as their revered reputations are on the line.
 
 Naturally, there are other outside forces to consider as the acrimonious overtones continue to flow between the brooding mega-powers. The famed instigator in Superman foe Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is realized as the high-tech billionaire nuisance that has an underlying scheme to eradicate both bickering super powers once and for all but not before Luthor pronounces his take on philosophical tirades. In the meantime, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is on board to profess her undying love and support for her desired dreamboat Superman. Luthor loathing Superman while Lane fantasizing about her strong flashy fly boy. In other words it is business as usual. While Superman is trying to figure out his place in the sun Snyder piles on the bothersome dreamy anxieties that plague the aging Wayne.
 
 **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** is a jumbled mess. Snyder undertakes a convoluted production and tries to sell it as a sophisticated meeting of the misplaced minds between two embattled entities embroiled in uncertainty and super-sized cynicism. Still, Snyder’s vision is mishandled as he seems to have forgotten one crucial point–simply making an action movie that registers with genuine thrills. One cannot help but stumble upon the pretentiousness and piousness that ruins this boneless blockbuster. The film finally decides to stack on the combinations of boisterous match-ups involving everyone but the kitchen sink but all comes off as frivolously forced. Cavell was never really an enticing Superman ever since he donned the big “S” on his chest back in 2013’s** Man of Steel**. Affleck’s Batman is a little more palatable but the constant scowl (both on his face and on the mask) is too much to digest. One would not mind yelling at the screen for Affleck’s alter ego to lighten up a bit.
 
 The supporting players are virtually wasted in this exhausting CGI popcorn pleaser. Eisenberg, normally a trustworthy performer with considerable scope, merely irritates as the punkish techno-magnate Luthor. The always radiant Adams is a wash as the gushing Lois Lane. Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons’s Alfred the butler won’t make anyone forget Micheal Caine’s take on Wayne’s trusty man servant anytime soon. Even the reliably adventurous Oscar-nominated actor Michael Shannon cannot exuberantly bring to life the menacing presence of Zod.
 
 Humorless and hackneyed, **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry. As for others, they will wonder what lies ahead in terms of other League of Justice movies that hopefully can muster up more entertaining stimulation than this over-indulgent doomsday dud. Is anyone up for **Wonder Woman vs. Redwing** with an empowering feminine twist?

 It is known that critics have no brain. It is the best Superman film as Henry Cavill in the red and blue suit. Yep, I know it is always DC versus Marvel, so it is then DC's reply to the 'Avengers'. I don't care their rivalries, as a film fanatic, I enjoy good films and I found it was so good. But I was a bit worried after the Superman was shown in a dark shade in the trailer, especially after Batwan was overly stylised by Nolan, I thought the black suit would take over. After watching the film I was relieved and happy that Batman was exposed.
 
 Batman fans might have been disappointed, but for the superhero and DC fans, this film is a great treat. You can't compare it with 'Avengers', it had its own style. It follows the 'Man of Steel' and directed by the same director. Excellent cast. I have never been the Ben Affleck hater, so I had no objection to his role in this. He did good along with Cavill and others. He would do better in his solo Batman films if Zack Snyder is retained to script and direct them.
 
 I'm not a comic book reader, so I did not know the story before the watch. I was surprised for the Wonder Woman's part in the film. The visuals were awesome, the story was unpredictable, well developed characters, cleverly composed scenes, wonderful stunt sequences and the film's overall tone was kind of dark and gloomy, a very satisfying superhero film. The content balance was perfect, but the characters did not do the same as we know Superman is a father of all superheroes.
 
 I already watched it twice and I can't wait for its sequel. Especially looking forward for Jesse Eisenberg, because he was kind of stayed low in this and I hope his character Lex becomes much stronger. It is a PG13, and there's nothing botherable stuffs in it for the underage audience, but I felt it is targeted for adults because of the matured flavour. Don't think about that I said, just watch it, it will definitely entertain you well if not blow you away. Surely recommended to all.

 I have to say that I bought this movie only because I felt I wanted it in my collection just for it to be complete. I was really expecting to be, shall we say, not impressed. A movie about Batman and Superman, heroes that I grew up with, fighting is not my kind of movie.
 
 In the end I realized that my expectations of crappines was not enough. I really disliked this movie. In short succession this movie turns several of my childhood heroes to bad guys and the greatest superman bad guy into a unstable hippie-like jerk that goes through the movie behaving like he is a drug addict. So basically this movie went drown the drains for me straight away and then I have not even gotten started about the plot. Actually I felt so annoyed over this crap that I actually spent time taking notes while I was watching.
 
 Let me see what I noted. Lex Luther is a fucking joke. Alfred, the same. Jimmy Olsen a fucking CIA agent? You got to be fucking kidding me! And not only does he screw Lois Lane but gets himself shot after a few seconds of screen time.
 
 Same stupid nonsense about XXX being too powerful, is a threat and needs to be government controlled that has been used in hundreds. if not thousands, of crappy low and high budget action movies. I hate that crap. It is stupid, stupid, stupid.
 
 Weird and totally uninteresting dream scenes, what the f... did the writer smoke? If they wanted to pad the movie it a) was a crappy way of doing it and b) why? With over three hours (Ultimate Edition) it is way to long for such a crappy movie anyway.
 
 Oh, here is a (somewhat) positive note at least. It was indeed rather funny that they had chosen CNN to spew out the nonsense conspiracy theories about Superman being responsible for the bomb in the wheelchair. Fake news anyone?
 
 I had a little bit of enjoyment of the movie during the last part of the movie when it finally turned into a bit of action. Batman’s car and plane was cool. The action, once Batman getting knocked on his head enough to get to his senses again, was a nice chunk of CGI goodness. That I have to admit.
 
 Okay, after three, mostly painful, hours the movie finally comes to an end. And what an end. Meh!!! Not only was it a crappy ending but they managed to drag it out forever with excruciatingly boring scenes.
 
 I am sure a lot of the above can be said to be subjective. For instance my dislike of the way my childhood characters where treated. I am not a professional reviewer though so this is my personal take of the movie. If you don’t like it, fine with me and good for you but do not feel obliged to tell me about it.",2.0
209112,5ad757419251413b2b010380,TheTenth,"Very short synopsis : Batman has been hit hard by the events of Man of Steel : a ""god"" descends on earth, is confronted by another god, and they fight, killing thousands of humans. He learns about a rock coming from his birth planet that can weaken or kill him. It's the property of Lex Luthor, who could target Superman too, but with evil purpose.
 
 So I won't go deeper in the story. This movie, unlike most other superhero movie, is targeting adults. I don't mean 18 or 21 year old, I mean mature beings that have endured bad things in life, and have taken the time to see the goods and bads of humanity. Yes, not the Marvel (Guardians of the galaxy, Ant man) target audience. Batman makes it clear (rejoined by the senator) : if a being is so powerful he can't be killed and can kill thousands, even if for now he does good, what happens if he becomes a villain? What laws or weapons can stop him?
 
 Now going back to the movie and how it presents its argument. We have Batman's introduction to the new DC movie universe (death of parents, tortured psyche ...) done during the opening credits. That is both efficient and powerful. Then we see Bruce Wayne at the time of the Superman / Zod battle. We also see humans being scared and killed. So, yeah it's superhero movie making not showing merry world with superheroes saving humans. And doing funny quotes. It's people (or super people) facing tragedy and growing up to see how the future has to be settled. And then a new villain appears. Or rather, he appears as a careless billionnaire showing off - how could he be perceived as dangerous? He has the chance of having Batman wanting to take down Superman, when he wants the same thing, so he can go for his secondary plan to use Krypton technology to change the world.
 
 So the last part of the movie is the fight of 3 super heroes against a creature created by the ""god""'s technology and humanity's madness/evilness. Yes, it's not a villain that is there because you need one to fight the bad guys, it's yet another consequence of Kryptonians coming to earth.
 
 So the films rolls out and I'm so stunned by the content I feel I was treated as a human being, not as a popcorn eating teenager or a comics fan. Just as someone that could appreciate great movie making.",

 Sure, I had my doubts of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, but halfway through the end those doubts were put to rest.
 And Ben Affleck was amazing as the latest incarnation of Batman. It was a long time since the actor did a superhero movie (Daredevil).
 My only critique was Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal as Lex Luthor - really cringing for me. Didn't do justice for the character (no pun intended)! Michael Fassbender would've been a more suitable role.

 I know this is a polarizing thing to say, but I loved this movie! I think Zack Snyder crushed it with the incredible production design, off-the-charts casting, and gritty take on a lost and weary Batman. The casting for this movie is a master stroke of brilliance. Ben Affleck’s Batman is jaded and bitter, taking his rage and loss out on the criminal element of Gotham. His hulking physique emphasizes Batman’s imposing strength over his gadgets when in combat. Zack Snyder also gave us Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, which we all know is one of the best choices in the comic book cinema world. The fight sequences are the best part of BvS; pitting godlike power against a man motivated by grief somehow seems possible and brutal because of Snyder’s writing and directing. Finally, the world-building and teases bring so much intrigue and excitement for future films. It isn’t a perfect film, but as a DC and Batman fan, it is one of my favorite comic book movies and stands out as refreshingly separate from all the bright-colored goofy Marvel movies of the time.",9.0

He did that Michael Keaton thing where he understood the link between Batman and Bruce Wayne and was able to pull off a good Bruce, and that is really where Batman is, figuring out which one is the mask and playing both accordingly.
 
 However, it starts... abruptly. It starts with the assumption that you have seen the Superman movies, and for viewers that hadn't it comes across as more than a little jarring. You were expected to understand what was happening from the start and, unfortunately, that's not the best way to start a film that doesn't have the number ""2"" after it.
 
 It doesn't have that slow build that explains the story, it just kind of starts and moves along as if the audience is already sucked in... and this with a new star as Batman, and a new universe to host him in.

 Or maybe we are supposed to learn something about global warming? We know about that already but few change their lives much and this film won't change that.

823219,67a3251ebeb17c876a9fd257,Brent Marchant,"Sometimes the simplest yet most profound messages we can receive come from the unlikeliest of sources. So it is with the second animated feature from writer-director Gints Zilbalodis, a stunningly beautiful, inspiringly insightful odyssey about a band of animals seeking to find their way and survive in a new world. When a great flood essentially destroys the world of man, a wide-eyed black cat must figure out how to get by when this consuming deluge wipes out the existence he has known, armed with only his own wits and the cooperation of fellow animal kindreds, including a capybara, a meerkat, a secretary bird and a pack of dogs, most notably a yellow Labrador retriever. Together this band of different creatures navigates the waters of this new world in an abandoned sailboat, learning how to work together to support one another and to stay alive, surmounting an array of challenges along the way. In the process, they collectively learn valuable life lessons that we as humans can all stand to follow, especially when confronted with circumstances not unlike those that we all must contend with in a world on the edge, conditions to which most of us can probably relate these days. The answers that these creatures come up with are often patently obvious, but the film thoughtfully prompts us to ask ourselves that, if these simple solutions are so readily apparent, why aren’t we doing more ourselves to embrace them in addressing our own current challenges? That’s a very good question and one of the greatest strengths of this widely acclaimed release. This dialogue-free offering, whose only sounds come from the authentic utterances of its animal protagonists and its emotive background score, features exquisite animation in its depiction of a world in transition, one showing the remnants of what’s been left behind and the emergence of what’s coming into being. While the narrative takes a little time to initially find its footing and is occasionally episodic as it unfolds, the various incidents it portrays as the story plays out are instructive, touching, meaningful and spot on in conveying the picture’s myriad insights, crafted in a way that shows more than tells and successfully avoids the temptation to spoon-feed audiences. “Flow” may be animated, but it’s by no means a cartoon, an accomplishment to which more films in this genre should attempt to aspire. This Golden Globe Award winner and Oscar nominee for best animated feature is a true gem, one from which we could all stand to learn a lot – and, one would hope, before we’re faced with circumstances like these ourselves.",8.0

823219,67df1c95e4a9c8690607b1c4,CinemaSerf,"After a fairly scary start with a group of growling dogs, our usually quite sedentary cat makes it’s way back to a comfortable bed just in time for an inundation to flood his surrounding forest dwelling. There is no sign of any human being anywhere, but a small boat floats by manned by a coypu. The cat hops aboard and after an initial spat, the host settles back to sleep and they continue to drift aimlessly along what appear to be brand new waterways, meeting an host of fellow creatures along the way. Some appear friendly, others less so with many of them dispossessed of their usual habitats and others rather thriving in their new aquatic environment. Initials suspicions and reticence starts to morph into something more friendly and the animals convey a message that better together might be their route to survival. Sometimes those choices cause conflict, or require leaps of faith and that is the message that is delivered quite effectively as their amiable escapades unfold. I didn’t find the animation that spectacular, but when married together with some intricately designed audio we are presented with a charming and quite potent tale of what makes them and, vicariously, us tick amidst a changing and beautifully imagined forest that also elicits an appreciation of a sense of change, vivacity, collaboration and of nature. It’s simply told, celebratory and enjoyable to watch.",7.0
823219,67ef8596ede8d82f3bad09de,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"Director Gints Zilbalodis has created a visionary work of art with “Flow,” an absolutely jaw-dropping, stunning animated film that takes viewers on a breathtaking journey through both the natural and mystical realms. Following a courageous cat and an unlikely band of animal companions as they navigate a flooded, post-apocalyptic world, the film is an emotionally charged, visually immersive film that combines high stakes, environmental themes, and an unforgettable sense of adventure.
 
 This is a film that completely drew me in from the very first frame, and not just with its beautiful animation, but with its deep, resonant story about survival, cooperation, and the fragility of our planet. This is one of the best films of the year, and it’s unlike anything I have ever seen before.
 
 The story centers around a little black cat whose home is devastated by a catastrophic flood. Forced to flee after a devastating event (there are no humans to be found and only traces of them remain), he eventually finds refuge on an abandoned boat. The cat teams up with a menagerie of other animals, including a capybara, a lemur, a bird, and a dog, all of whom have been displaced from their homes. Relying on trust, courage, and their collective wits to survive the increasingly dangerous environment, the animals must now work together to navigate the perilous waters in search of dry land.
 
 What sets this story apart from other animated films is its compelling and unique approach to animal behavior. While the animals display primal instincts, the film also incorporates a fantasy element where they seem to take on more human-like qualities (thankfully none talk, and no words are spoken in the entire film).
 
 Zilbalodis and his team focus on a more nuanced, naturalistic portrayal of these animals rather than having the characters engage in zany antics or delivering silly punchlines. There are subtle hints, like exploring the solitary nature of the cat while watching as he slowly learns the benefits of cooperating with others. One of the more interesting aspects of the story is when the animals form mini societies on their floating vessels, giving the film an intriguing balance between realism and imagination. Even through non-verbal communication, the interactions between the characters feel authentic, especially as their survival instincts kick in. This is incredibly thoughtful and sophisticated storytelling.
 
 The visual style is breathtaking, as the film is set in a lush, flooded world. Everything feels so meticulously crafted in a way that evokes the haunting beauty and disquieting peril of a newly aquatic landscape. Just when you think the film can’t look any more spectacular, yet another scene comes along that’s even more stunning than the last. This is one for lovers of the art form of cinema.
 
 The floodwaters that have taken over the planet become a character in their own right, creating an atmosphere of constant tension and uncertainty. Everything about this film kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a story of survival, and the animals struggle. This isn’t a story that’s all wrapped up in a neat little bow, and the environmental themes are a substantial, poignant meditation on climate change and the destruction of our planet’s ecosystems.
 
 Zilbalodis wisely avoids making things too bleak or heavy-handed and finds moments of hope and warmth through the animals’ shared journey. There’s a beautiful message about cooperation and the power of friendship, especially in the face of insurmountable odds, that provides a constant (if faint) feeling of much appreciated optimism.
 
 At its heart, “Flow” is a film about survival, trust, and community. Its narrative may be simple, but it’s filled with profound emotional depth. Whether you’re an animal lover or someone who enjoys a thoughtful ecological tale, this film offers something for everyone. It’s a beautifully crafted adventure that doesn’t shy away from difficult topics, but it also fills you with a sense of wonder and possibility.
 
 By combining impressive visuals, heartfelt storytelling, and a powerful environmental message, “Flow” is as enchanting as it is thought-provoking. I was deeply moved by the film’s themes and captivated by not only the beauty of the animation, but also its overall spirit.

It wasn't bad, it wasn't disturbing, it was just jarring and off putting, almost like the videos you see on social media of people cleaning barnacles off whales with a broom, it's that level of jarring and off putting.
 
 But the story is actually not bad, it's a bit on the fun side and a bit on the heart warming side, so consider it a good review.  I wouldn't watch it a second time, but I am glad that I watched it once.  It was satisfying.",5.0
945961,66bf997750532dab3d489b6e,r96sk,"<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.
 
 Of the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.
 
 The plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.
 
 Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.
 
 I also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.
 
 All in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",8.0
945961,66c4580a26f0991085d11a34,CinemaSerf,"I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. ""Rain"" (Cailee Spaeny) and her ""brother"" are looking to get off-planet but she can't get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and ""Andy"" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys ""Tyler"" (Archie Renaux) and ""Bjorn"" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the ""Romulus"" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. ""Andy"" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of ""Rook"" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort ""Kay"" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a ""company"" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other ""Alien"" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, ""get away from her..."" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",7.0
945961,66c53a7110b4348dd3971f82,MovieGuys,"Whilst not as awful as the Aliens franchise films that came after the excellent first and second films, starring Sigourney Weaver, Alien Romulus is not without its shortcomings. 
 
 Whats immediately noticeable, in spite of the rugged, industrial setting, is a cast that look like they just escaped from the set of Beverly Hills 90210. Youthful, fresh faced, physically unimposing, with not a grease stain or blemish in sight, they feel badly out of place. 
 
 If you can put the sense of disbelief regarding the casting aside (I couldn't) the actual story fares only marginally better. It feels like a borrowed affair, where its taken aspects of the first two successful films and tried to craft a newer iteration.
 
 The results an alright, if at times, somewhat ridiculous story, punctuated by moments of compelling action. That said, haven't we seen it all before, in one form or another? 
 
 In summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an ""okay"" watch that's fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.",6.0
945961,66d63f7b4c59aca41db65fea,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by “Alien: Romulus,” a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.
 
 Going back to the roots of the “Alien” franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.
 
 The strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn’t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn’t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise’s good will, it actually has some substance.
 
 There’s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film’s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There’s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past “Alien” films.
 
 I was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don’t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that’s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny’s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.
 
 The film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.
 
 “Alien: Romulus” is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it’s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.

 ""Alien: Romulus is an impressive technical spectacle that highlights Fede Álvarez's talent in creating an atmosphere of tension and horror, raising the audiovisual standard of the saga to new heights through immersive sound design and Galo Olivares' stunning cinematography, which deserves countless accolades.
 
 However, its excessive reliance on references to the past prevents it from reaching its full narrative potential, as well as achieving a thematic impact similar to the franchise's best installments.
 
 Despite this, the captivating performances of Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, along with a third act filled with insane entertainment, make this interquel a cinematic experience worth seeing in IMAX, even if it leaves the feeling that it could have been more daring and innovative.""

945961,670ffb42cf8de877b49f6792,Mister BLAQK,"Alien: Romulus is a love letter to the 1979 classic, and while I dug the whole philosophical space-god thing in Prometheus, this stripped-down, back-to-basics approach had me hooked from the first frame.  It's been a while since an Alien film truly captured that sense of claustrophobic dread, and Romulus nails it.
 
 This movie is gorgeous, plain and simple. The lighting, the camera angles, and Benjamin Wallfisch's score – it all blends together to create this constant tension that just sucks you in. There's this one scene where Rain, Andy and Tyler are being chased through the research station, the way they use the shadows and movement, it's like a masterclass in suspense. It totally reminded me of the most terrifying moments from the original. It's obvious Álvarez was obsessed with recreating that gritty, lived-in feel of the first Alien, and it pays off big time.
 
 The cast is solid too. Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson absolutely kill it as Rain and Andy.  I'll admit, I was worried Andy would be your typical forgettable sidekick, but he actually gets a pretty interesting arc.  Sure, most of the crew are basically there to get picked off by the Xenomorph, but Andy was a standout supporting character. He basically played two roles. It's refreshing that the movie doesn't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary characters.
 
 One thing this movie does really well is finding that sweet spot between horror and action that made the first two films so iconic.  Alien 3 was so bleak, and Resurrection was just bonkers action – this one feels like a proper blend of both.  Fede Álvarez basically throws in all the best Alien tropes: the ragtag crew, the creepy body horror stuff, the tense hide-and-seek scenes, and some kickass action sequences. And you know what? It totally works.
 
 I was impressed at a lot of the creative set pieces and how they built tension. Like how they played with gravity to avoid the acid and trying to sneak past the facehuggers by camoflaging their body temperature. They were really cool and shockingly unique and fresh for a nearly 50 old franchise. And let's talk about that body horror. There's this one scene, a seriously messed-up vaginal birth, that is going to be burned into my brain for a while. Álvarez definitely gets what makes this franchise tick.
 
 I'm giving Alien: Romulus a strong 7/10.  It lost some points for the use of the CGI Ian Holm. It's so distracting, and they rely on it way too much.  Also, there some lines that were stuck in there for nostalgia that felt out of place.  But honestly, those are minor nitpicks in a movie that's this much fun. The whole final act, with the station crashing into the asteroid field and that epic showdown with the Human/ Xeno, is just pure chaos in the best way possible.

 I enjoyed this movie a lot. It didn't try to be edgy or special - it seems to be directed by a guy who loved the first 2 Alien movies from the 80ies and wanted to add a movie as best as he could do in our time which is still faithful to those 2 original movies and could be considered a worthy addition to the original ""Alien"" storyline.
 
 The acting was overall very good. Cailee Spaeny as the lead actress gave a solid performance as expected. But the surprise of the movie was David Jonsson as her android ""brother"", who was the highlight of the movie actingwise for me.

After all, it isn't held in particularly high regard by the legions of loyal fans who absolutely adore these films for their often groundbreaking achievements and idolise the inexhaustible resourcefulness of Ellen Ripley. Unfortunately, these same loyal fans aren't going to find anything worth adoring or idolising in this latest effort.

945961,676f05b53dff0de99b618253,RoRo Nereus,"Fede Álvarez delivers a film in Alien: Romulus that tries to revitalize the franchise but stumbles on several key aspects. While visually appealing and faithful to the oppressive atmosphere characteristic of the saga, the movie lacks a solid narrative and memorable characters.
 
 The script relies too heavily on genre clichés, with bland dialogue and unconvincing decisions from its protagonists. Attempts to explore philosophical themes about survival and human nature remain superficial, leaving the impression that the film tries to tackle more than it can handle.
 
 Álvarez’s direction, which has shone in the past with more intimate horror projects, feels overwhelmed in such an established universe. The moments of tension and terror fail to achieve the desired impact, falling into an uneven rhythm that alternates between dull and predictable.
 
 For the most devoted fans of Alien, this installment is particularly disappointing. In an unfortunate parallel to Disney's mishandling of the Star Wars saga, Romulus feels like a production that prioritizes franchise formulas over true innovation or respect for the original spirit. Rather than expanding the Alien legacy, the film dilutes it, leaving a bitter aftertaste for fans who had expected much more.
 
 Ultimately, Alien: Romulus fails to live up to its heritage, becoming a missed opportunity and a reminder that not all cinematic revivals are necessary.",4.0

 The script is just ... stupid and the dialogues even worse. The characters are not believable. I mean, when you watch Twilight, you just swallow the whole thing because it is fantasy and ... OK, it is just a stupid vampires story but, this is just toooooooo bad.
 
 I've not read the book but I suspect the fail is not just in the movie but that it is adapting something that is already bad from the beginning.
 
 The worst is that I kind of liked Dornan in his role in Fallen but this movie has made me realize what a short range of performing resources he has. Dakota Johnson is not too bad, though. The acting is OK, it is just that you hate such an stupid character.

 I honestly didn't even want to watch the movie after encountering that.
 
 However, let's be honest, you aren't sitting down to watch the film because of dialogue or plot.
 
 You're watching it because of sex. And, out of all the movies, this one actually delivers the most on it. AND, unlike all the sequels, it doesn't claim to be about anything else. It advertises itself as a movie about kinky sex and it delivers as being a movie about kinky sex.

A bit of flirting ensues as he makes it quite clear that he is interested - but boy, is she in for a surprise when she discovers that all belts and braces does actually having another meaning (as does butt-plug!). What now follows is, I felt, a really tame exercise in soft porn that is about as sexy as putting out the wheelie bin. Dornan is very easy on the eye, but otherwise we are all subjected to a dull, ploddingly produced series of poorly lit scenes that drag on interminably. There's no point evaluating the acting nor the script, they don't matter. This is just a poor attempt to entertain or shock or both that does neither, remotely. Titillatingly tantalising?

In total fairness, it's not one I'd class as it being awfully bad, though that's only thanks to the two leads and the (now well known) music.
 
 There is enough chemistry between Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, they are good actors so are able to alleviate the many mundane moments. The only issue I hold for either is Dornan's accent. I know him and his Northern Irish voice, so the American chatter took me out a bit.
 
 Of course this is a movie largely about the sex, I guess parts of which are OK but too much made me cringe or raise my red flag (as intended for the latter, I hope). The run time should've been trimmed, it does feel like the characters go in circles for large periods - 90min movie all day.
 
 The music is solid, to be fair. Admittedly I already knew and liked the songs from Ellie Goulding and The Weeknd, nice to link them to the movie that made them though. So all in all, not for me. I am curious to see how they managed to stretch this out for a trilogy, mind you.",5.0

 28 Days Later is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Megan Burns, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Ecclestone. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.
 
 When animal liberation activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Center, they come across a scientist who tells them that to release these chimps would be insane. They have been injected with a test serum known as ""Rage"", and it's highly contagious and spreads easily and quickly. Ignoring the warnings, one of the activists opens a cage and is attacked and bitten by a chimp and rage quickly spreads among the group...
 
 28 days later... 
 
 The amazing thing with Danny Boyles's 28 Days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of George Romero's zombie films, and John Wyndham and Richard Matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. Film is quintessentially British, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated London for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. These are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely Hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (CG is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day). 
 
 There's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. Yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. Besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. It's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by Murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.
 
 It's easy to see why America made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the UK, film went to America and made it big. Americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on Romero rediscovering his mojo. Worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. The success ensured a sequel would follow, where Boyle and Garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for ""28 Weeks Later"". It's not as raw as ""Days"", but it's gorier and itself also a fine ""infected"" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what Boyle and Garland clinically created in 2002.

170,640b2d32caaca200d7364273,Ricardo Oliveira,"""28 Days Later"" is a British horror movie directed by Danny Boyle and starring Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. The film tells the story of Jim (Cillian Murphy), a courier who wakes up from a coma to find London abandoned and overrun by rage-infected humans.
 
 The film's opening sequence is one of the most iconic and powerful in horror movie history. Jim wakes up in a hospital room to find the world he knew has disappeared, and the eerily deserted streets of London make for an unsettling and ominous backdrop.
 
 The film is expertly paced, with a gradual buildup of tension that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The infected humans are terrifying, fast-moving, and relentlessly violent, and the film's use of sound and lighting only heightens their impact.
 
 One of the standout features of ""28 Days Later"" is the excellent acting by Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. Murphy delivers a convincing performance as Jim, a man struggling to survive in a world gone mad, while Harris shines as Selena, a tough survivor who has learned to navigate the dangers of the new world.
 
 The film's themes of survival, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit are powerful and thought-provoking. As Jim and Selena make their way through the deserted streets of London, they encounter a range of characters, each with their own story of survival and loss.
 
 The film's cinematography and visual effects are also top-notch, with haunting and memorable shots of a deserted London and intense action sequences that will leave you breathless.
 
 Overall, ""28 Days Later"" is a masterful horror movie that sets the bar high for the genre. The film's excellent acting, pacing, and visuals make for a truly unforgettable experience. I would rate ""28 Days Later"" a 8 out of 10.

Pretty swiftly they realise that very little of this new scenario is much safer for them and their thoughts turn to leaving...! This is quite an effective apocalyptic tale of corrupted science and morals and uses, for most of the first section of the film, dialogue sparingly allowing the eerie photography and soundtrack of a largely abandoned London to set the scene for us. Thereafter the writing isn't the best, but the benign sense of menace exuded by Eccleston and the confidence of both Harris and the young Burns work well at giving us an almost claustrophobic sense of peril, especially as we drift to a denouement that is cleverly constructed to make us think. It's bleak and threatening at times, not without the odd dark humour and in the end presents us with quite an intriguing look at humanity in many of it's less attractive, more visceral, guises. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland keep a few twists for the tale at the end, too, and Murphy holds it all together in an understatedly potent fashion.",7.0

 Cillian Murphy. Naomie Harris. Brendan Gleeson. Christopher Eccleston. All of them play their part, obviously Murphy is the main man but Harris and Gleeson are very good in their respective roles. The direction of Eccleston's character is blatant, but nevertheless entertaining.

The whole set-up is severely underwhelming, the whole plot with the rich family just didn't do it for me. It does pick up at the conclusion, which is where I see the potential.
 
 A movie solely about the Kintners and the unicorns could've been ace, especially if it lent into the fantasy side of it; almost if it was <i>(iffy association incoming)</i> <em>'How to Train Your Dragon'</em>-esque, just with all the gore and death that this 2025 releaes does hold.

It doesn’t start so promisingly as we meet “Elliot” (Paul Rudd) who is travelling with his estranged teenage daughter “Ridley” (Jenny Ortega) to the remote wilderness home of his would-be benefactors whom he is hoping will give him power of attorney over a large lump of cash. “Odell” (Richard E. Grant) is the patriarch, and on his last legs; “Belinda” (Téa Leoni) is his wife and “Shep” (Will Poulter) his sharp as a spoon son - and “Elliott” is out to impress. Thing is, he is very late for their appointment. Why? Well they hit something on the road to the house and, well it isn’t the kind of thing you meet on the road every day - even if you are Tom Cruise. They assume this critter is no more, so imagine their surprise when it starts to make it’s presence felt in their host’s car park! A bit of research reveals not just what this is, but also that it’s blood could have miraculous healing powers (think phoenix’s tears). Could this be the miracle cure old “Odell” is looking for? Well more likely it is the source of grief for all concerned when it’s mum and dad realise it’s not come home to their cave for supper and set off, quite angrily, to retrieve their offspring. The story tries to introduce a little elemental fantasy to the proceedings, but with the possible exception of Leoni who seems to be prepared to go with the joke, the others aren’t really at the races. Grant resorts to uber-ham mode, Poulter tries but has little to work with and neither Rudd nor Ortega do much with this “Bambi” does “Jurassic Park” enterprise. There’s a fun role for Anthony Carrigan as their “Lurch” style factotum “Griff” - the only one in the whole thing who might actually have a brain, but otherwise this is all a triumph for girth over substance.

 Taking place where “Spider-Man: Far From Home” ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.
 
 As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.
 
 Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.
 
 Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).
 
 Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.
 
 As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.
 
 What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.
 
 The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.
 
 The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.
 
 While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.
 
 There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.

 ""Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the darkest, saddest, emotionally draining entries in the MCU, surpassing all of my expectations.
 
 Despite a messy, convoluted first half with some pacing issues and occasionally frustrating, poorly placed humor, Jon Watts, Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers more than compensate these minor issues with some of the best (and brutally violent) Spider-Man action ever witnessed on screen.
 
 In addition to this, the surprisingly coherent narrative packs shocking developments and actually offers enough screentime for the villains to significantly impact Peter Parker's arc. Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.
 
 A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.

It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.
 
 The cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'Spider-Man'</em> - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.
 
 Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.
 
 Onto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.
 
 This really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!",10.0

Fun seeing the old guard in here with Maguire and Garfield along with their foes and at least their inclusions didn't feel as forced as I feared when this movie was first announced.

634649,62b88a8767203d0d3888ba62,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is another Spider Man for kids which for me is a wee bit unfortunate. I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this naïve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.
 
 In addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?
 
 The good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.
 
 The rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.
 
 Another thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.
 
 It is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.
 
 Instead they just piled on the childish, naïve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.",5.0

 Watching No Way Home felt like my childhood and my adulthood were embracing each other in a warm, friendly hug. The nostalgia was brilliantly balanced with advancing Tom Holland's Spider-man and developing his character. Andrew Garfield's Spider-man also received some long-awaited closure after an abrupt end to his story. The effects, action, and humor all reinforced a heartfelt film focusing on the characters' processing of loss and grief.",10.0
634649,630ae8b432489b007e863578,tmdb28039023,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is like the proverbial blind squirrel that finds a nut every now and then, except that it doesn’t so much find them as it steals them from another squirrel’s hoard. The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it’s barely a film at all to begin with – it’s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies.
 
 If I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002’s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004’s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, “the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with ""Superman""”. How the mighty have fallen. It’s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty – or rather the nostalgia – wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi’s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.
 
 When Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock’s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices – first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.
 
 All things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human – and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor – than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work – and not even the best work at that – of a much more talented filmmaker. To put it bluntly, Spider-Man: No Way Home has absolutely no reason for being.",1.0

411,5fa1d9ae96e30b0037348481,r96sk,"Long bloody title, but a great film no doubt.
 
 I had seen <em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'</em> before but hadn't watched it for years and years, I remembered the vast majority though - it's a memorable film after all. There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much.
 
 It has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him.
 
 Elsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too.
 
 I've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me. They'll do well to match this first film, that's for sure.",9.0
411,65399e96b87aec00c3a2aa6c,MustachedMovieMan,"In my last review (which you can find on my Letterboxd), I said _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ was a ""nearly perfect film."" Well, I am here to say that with this viewing, to me, it is a perfect film. 
 
 I used to always think this film was a sort of step below LOTR, and, while LOTR is indeed a masterpiece of cinema, I don't regard this film as lesser.
 
 The movie is just pure magic! Every aspect of the movie (minus the CGI – which doesn't really hold up [except for Aslan] but is still serviceable) is even better with age! And I find myself moved emotionally by more things this time than I ever have watching this film.
 
 The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is just phenomenal. Especially ""The Battle"" – that goes without saying. But this time, part of the magic and nostalgia I was struck by was the musical piece that sounds like it's a song. The one that plays while the train is leaving London. (I found out it's actually about halfway into the track ""Evacuating London."") That magical song, combined with the great camera work by Donald M. McAlpine and the appearance of the movie title makes for feelings of peak nostalgia and magic for me.
 
 Also, this film has one of the best opening scenes of all time. When Netflix (finally) remakes the films, I don't know how they can top this opening. 
 – In fact, that's another thing about this movie: There are so many things that I don't think any remake could top. Liam Neeson as Aslan, Tilda Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch, and James McAvoy as Tumnus. – Oh, and, though he's not in the book, the centaur, Oreius (played by Patrick Kake), is so cool! Can't top that.
 
 Also, the costuming is excellent – especially for the White Witch – and the gryphons are so cool! The sound design on their shriek gives me chills (in a good way).
 
 And I can't go without saying that this is also an emotional story because of what the story represents, the symbolism of the story.
 Edmund represents us – represents me, a sinner. I who have walked in rebellion against God, and who am by nature opposed to God. And as such, I deserve the wrath of God, punishment that He would be fully just to give me. But Aslan represents Jesus Christ. Like Aslan sacrificed himself for Edmund, dying the death he should have died, Jesus sacrificed Himself in our stead, taking upon Himself the wrath of God we deserved, so that “if [we] confess with [our] mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in [our] heart that God raised Him from the dead, [we] will be saved” (Romans 10:9), we “will not perish but have eternal life” (from John 3:16), and as a result of that faith, “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (from Romans 5:1).
 
 ‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:1‭-‬10‬
 
 > “[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— [3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— [6] and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast. [10] For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”",10.0
411,669b8697433457e0c2db1495,CinemaSerf,"CS Lewis certainly had one heck of an imagination and it is rarely better exemplified than in this lovely fantasy adventure. Four wartime siblings are evacuated from London to stay with the reclusive ""Professor Kirke"" (Jim Broadbent) in the relative safety of the English countryside. Once they get there, the housekeeper ""Mrs. Macready"" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. ""Lucy"" takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets ""Mr. Tumnus"" (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of ""Narnia"" meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the ""Pevensie"" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous ""White Witch"" (Tilda Swinton). They align with ""Aslan"" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great. Indeed, some of the effects are a bit cheap and cheerful for 2005; but the story, settings and characterisations are great - as is Harry Gregson-Williams' eerie and gentle score.",7.0
411,6761a675b80a974245cbee5c,RalphRahal,"Rewatching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe reminded me why it’s such a timeless movie. It still gets me every time, especially the lullaby scene with Mr. Tumnus, played beautifully by James McAvoy, who is one of my favorite actors. Liam Neeson’s voice as Aslan is inspiring and adds so much gravitas to the character. But for me, the standout is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Her performance is chilling and commanding, making her one of the most memorable parts of the movie.
 
 The production is top-notch. The visuals are stunning, especially considering it was released in 2005, and they mostly hold up well even now. The costumes and set design are fantastic, capturing the magical and otherworldly feel of Narnia. The soundtrack is another highlight, adding emotional depth to key moments and making the experience even more immersive.
 
 Based on the beloved novel by C.S. Lewis, the film does a good job of sticking to the important plot points while making the story accessible to a new generation. Of course, no adaptation is perfect, but this one stands on its own as a great piece of fantasy storytelling. It’s not just a movie; it’s a journey into a world full of magic, courage, and redemption.
 
 This movie also feels like the perfect pick for the holiday season. It has that warmth and wonder that makes it ideal to watch with family at Christmas. The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe remains a classic, and I can’t recommend it enough for anyone who wants to experience a bit of magic",7.0

Even in a series a movie ought to have a decent local climax -- for example,  Kat and Peeta winning the Hunger Games.",
198663,5a3d1dbac3a368148f0acd87,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"One thing that I liked about this movie from the start was that it was, in my limited experience at least, somewhat original. Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.
 
 On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a “young adult” movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.
 
 In my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.
 
 I did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?
 
 Sometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.
 
 Bottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.

A quick bout of wrestling with ""Gally"" (Will Poulter) reminds him that his name is ""Thomas"" but that still doesn't help him - or anyone else - with what he's doing here. Each day the great doors of the maze open up, but anyone who does try to make it out is never heard from again. The lads are completely clueless until a girl is sent amongst them, and she ""Teresa"" (Kaya Scodelario) might just have the answer as ""Thomas"" manages to galvanise a few of his pals to test the secrets of the maze. Can they escape, and if they do - what are they escaping too? Is it freedom or might it actually be worse? They do know that the maze is being patrolled by some menacing metal monsters so it's quite a dangerous leap of faith they must take - but it's either that or staying put. This is clearly part one of a franchise, so much of it is simply character establishment with some ground rules laid down for them and us. A reliable cast of associates help keep the film story and the characters develop well enough - though quite why Londoner Poulter had to have an American accent is anyone's guess. The Dashner novels upon which this is based follow a familiar line, but director Wes Ball tries to keep the film moving along quickly with plenty of moments of peril, acrobatics and using a star whom the camera likes and who energetically enters into the spirit of this adventure.

198663,67619a89bb15907cd318a5c1,RalphRahal,"Re-watching The Maze Runner was a pleasant experience, and I still enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. The film's directing stands out, with a well-paced first act that successfully introduces us to the characters, the maze, and their unsettling situation. This setup provides a strong foundation for an exciting second act and a finale that leaves the audience with lingering questions, perfectly setting the stage for the sequel.
 
 The cinematography deserves praise as well. A standout moment is the opening sequence: the close-up shots immerse us in the disoriented perspective of the protagonist, only to transition smoothly to a zoom-out that reveals the towering, closed walls of the maze. This visual storytelling continues throughout the movie, maintaining a consistent sense of scale and tension.
 
 The acting is another strong point. Most of the cast delivers solid performances, creating believable connections and helping viewers grow attached to each character. Their chemistry and emotional delivery effectively add weight to the story's stakes.
 
 While the script is generally solid, it does feature a few clichéd jokes here and there, but these moments don't detract much from the overall experience.

 Man…. I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team.

575264,64b349a3378062011c8b36f8,Brent Marchant,"In the interest of full disclosure, I’m often somewhat skeptical about films that include the word “part” in their titles; I frequently feel that such offerings have difficulty standing on their own, unable to complete their stories in a single vehicle. So, admittedly, that consideration was on my mind as I screened the first half of the final installment in this long-running action-adventure franchise. To its credit, director Christopher McQuarrie’s latest has a lot going for it – an intriguing plot with a strong cautionary tale message for us about the potential dangers of AI, an array of superbly staged action sequences, the welcome addition of some much-needed comic relief (something this series has often lacked) and a fine cast of supporting performers (especially the expanded role of Vanessa Kirby, who was woefully underused in the franchise’s previous release). However, with that said, there are some elements that could use improvement. For starters, the picture is simply too long; with a runtime of 2:43:00 (and this is just the first half of the story!), the film is definitely bloated and could stand some judicious editing, especially in the action sequences, several of which begin to try one’s patience after a while. Then there are certain aspects of the narrative that are predictable, formulaic, and, at times, implausible (particularly in the picture’s overlong final act train adventure sequence), qualities that are not as apparent (or at least better hidden) in previous outings. Finally, there are the underwhelming performances of the IMF crew (Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames). The leader of the pack (Cruise) comes across more like someone whose presence is designed largely to carry the plot rather than serve as a genuine, actively engaged protagonist, and his two colleagues are underused, seemingly playing sidekick roles rather than participating as key characters (unlike previous installments in the series). All told, this is by no means a bad picture, but it could have been better, especially with it being the series finale. It makes me wonder if the full story of “Dead Reckoning” might have been better executed in a single, slightly longer offering than as two separate feature-length releases. That might have solved the issues noted above, and it may have eliminated that nagging “part” problem I wrote about, allowing the picture to stand on its own two feet as a single vehicle. We’ll have to wait another year to see how it all plays out, but I can’t exactly say I’m holding my breath about it.",7.0
575264,64ba5c5706f98400e1169ed0,CinemaSerf,"I'm not really a great fan of Tom Cruise. Yes, he does his own stunts and is as fit as a fiddle, but as an actor - well don't let's have too many scenes that require him to actually put his heart and soul into them. Luckily, there are only a few such scenes here as the rest of this is an enjoyable, quickly paced, continuation of the MI strand with this time, an elusive antagonist that reminded me a little of the ""Forbin Project"" (1970). The military have created the perfect intelligence that is locked into the sonar dome of a state-of-the-art Russian submarine. Seems though, that this dome isn't that impregnable and when a cleverly manipulated catastrophe hits the sub, it soon becomes clear that this gadget has, and is rapidly honing, a mind of it's own. The only way to stop it is to obtain the two conjoining parts of a cruciform key - and then discover the location of the sunken wreck, if there is to be any hope of thwarting it taking over the world. The story is more the stuff of ""007"", I thought, but it is a good, solid and well written story - and one that resonates well on a planet where technology and communications are pervasive across all aspects of our lives. Together with Ving Rhames and the (always annoying, sorry) Simon Pegg it falls to ""Ethan"" (Cruise) to ally with his deadly pal ""Ilsa"" (Rebecca Ferguson) and the nimble-fingered ""Grace"" (Hayley Atwell) to stop the key from falling into the hands of the enigmatic ""Gabriel"" (Esai Morales). End-to-end action; trains, planes and automobiles, parachutes and just like in ""Fast X"" (2023) poor old Rome comes in for a bit of a pasting - as does Venice and the Orient Express would now present even ""Hercule Poirot"" with an insurmountable whodunnit challenge.

575264,64bdab4dad50f0013b127c02,MovieGuys,"Spectacular cinematic action let down by an incoherent story and shallow characterisations. 
 
 As is almost always the case with the MI franchise, the latest offering dishes up spectacular, highly polished, explosive action. Regrettably it comes at the price of a coherent story and rounded characterisations. 
 
 The story feels like it was made to accommodate the excess of exposition. Its a jumbled mess of poorly articulated ideas, that is, unsurprisingly, difficult to follow. Its not helped at all by an over abundance of peripheral characters. They simply add to the confused jumble and just as unsurprisingly, are never given the chance to display any depth of characterisation. 
 
 The results a film I personally found frustrating to watch. It boiled down to a series of action plot devices, including car chases and train wrecks. Certainly, some thought went into these sequences but because there is an absence of a solid story and believable characters, to cement the whole thing together, they don't amount to much, on their own.
 
 In short, polished action but for me, lacks the key factors that bind any film together, including a decent story and characterisations. In short, I can't really recommend this one, in spite of being a fan of the franchise.",6.0
575264,64cca28c43cd5400add62db6,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"The Tom Cruise “Mission Impossible” franchise is one of reliable quality and equally dependable “forgettable-ness.” I’ve seen every film, yet my memory is fuzzy when I try to recall what happened in any of them. And while it’s almost a given that “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it’s still one of the best of the bunch. Not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. This is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and I loved every minute of it.
 
 World class field agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the CIA called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). His team, including associates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) have become close friends, and they’re a well-oiled machine when working together. They regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. The entire world is at stake, and Ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.
 
 In order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it’s best not to read too much about the plot. What works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. The stakes are high and there’s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. As one character puts it, they’re fighting “an enemy that’s everywhere and nowhere.” It’s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.
 
 There are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren’t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous MI films). The high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. From a dramatic footrace through the canals of Venice to motorcycle jumps in the Austrian Alps to an epic car chase through the streets of Rome, there’s never a dull moment. There’s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.
 
 There are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of Grace (Hayley Atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and Paris (Pom Klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong Harley Quinn vibes. This movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. Seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and Pegg and Rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. There’s excellent work from the supporting cast too (Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, and Shea Whigham). Cruise is starting to show his age, but he’s still one of Hollywood’s greatest working superstars. His performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.
 
 It’s clear that this is a movie that’s older and wiser and in turn, it’s made with more mature audiences in mind. Nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). This is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.
 
 “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn’t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. Instead, it’s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that’ll leave you salivating for the second half. This is a movie that could stand alone, but I’m awfully glad it doesn’t.",9.0

575264,653df83bc8a5ac011d6d5767,JPV852,"Good stuntwork as usual from this series and the performances were well done and nice seeing the return of Henry Czeny as Kittridge and filling in the gaps from the first movie and that deal made with Max. They did a decent enough job with a villain that was essentially A.I. by giving it a face with Esai Morales's Gabriel character, albeit compared with the others in the franchise, was pretty weak. And for Cruise, he's at home as Ethan Hunt while the rest of the team had their moments.
 
 The only drawback is some of the dialogue, especially during the intelligence agencies meeting, felt stilted probably because it was basically exposition dump.
 
 It's not on the level of the past few movies but still entertaining, just had hoped the splitting of two movies thing was over and done with or at least was made justifiable (like Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame), which I'm not sure it is here. **3.75/5**",8.0
575264,658b8664b686b92480de26bb,snunes97,"This is the weakest M:I movie so far, which doesn't mean it's bad but it definitely has a few critical issues. The smaller issue is the pointless action sequences. This movie has a couple of overly long sequences that drag on for way too long and serve no purpose. They bring nothing new to the table in terms of stunts and don't add anything to the story. It's just padding and noise. However, the biggest issue is the plot about artificial intelligence. The filmmakers seem very insecure about the audience's ability to understand the themes used in the story. As a result, there are multiple long scenes where characters sit in a room and repeatedly speak about certain plot elements, in different levels of detail, as if they're trying to make sure the audience understands what they're talking about. I think ""rogue computer program"" is something that most people would understand, but the movie really tries to make this concept much deeper than it needs to be for the purpose of the movie, resulting in multiple needlessly complex exposition scenes. All of this to say that the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if you could trim the pointless action sequences and the tech jargon. As it stands, Dead Reckoning Part Two is going to have to do some very heavy lifting in order to compensate for this bloated Part One.",6.0
575264,65b9542c33a37600e6858361,whitsbrain,"**Mission Impossible** has been out-Bonding James Bond for years now. Tom Cruise continues to churn out movies that bring more fun and escapism than anyone else. He's a strange guy but his run of super-entertaining films over the last couple of decades has been amazing. This time, his character Ethan Hunt battles an all-knowing AI called ""The Entity"" and frankly, it's kind of a lame villain. The embodiment (sort of) of The Entity is Gabriel, who gives Ethan a baddie that he can punch. It's all rather confusing and convoluted, but the cast of characters and the action sequences are really what makes this latest **MI** movie a blast. Again.
 
 I was actually looking most forward to seeing Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa. Her character has always brought so much acrobatic grace and fridged detachment to her fighting in scraps with the bad guys. She isn't in this installment much, but when she is, it's impossible to look away. In fact, the ladies of **MI:7** are the best thing about it. Grace (Hayley Atwell) is magnetic and provides some real chemistry with Ethan. She was the person to care about the most. She was tough but also just naive enough to want to invest in emotionally. Her final ""deal"" with Kittridge makes me wonder if they are setting her up as the main character once Cruise leaves the franchise. The characters of Paris and The White Widow owned their screen time, as well. And of course, Luther and Benji are a solid pair, dropping in and out of the movie as needed.
 
 Thinking back on the action, there were so many great sequences. The runaway train was great but the car chase in Rome was one of the best that I can remember seeing in any movie.
 
 As has been stated often by others, this movie is a little long and the fact that it's a ""Part One"" doesn't help it at all, but the strong cast and balls-to-the-wall action make this another very good entry in the **Mission Impossible** series.",8.0
575264,65ef1fe41b722c0186d54bc9,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Overall this is a fairly entertaining movie. It has a reasonably cool, totally unrealistic of course, but cool story. It has plenty of special effects, lots of action, some mild suspense and a bit, sometimes too much, humor.
 
 Overall it is in the same style as the previous movies and that brings me to the gripe I have had with these movies since the movie part of the franchise started. This is yet another movie where Ethan is betrayed and goes off doing his own thing. Seriously? The original Mission Impossible was agents doing cool stuff with the full backing of their organisation. Not this bloody Hollywood secret agent soap opera crap.
 
 Another issue I have is that, as usual when Hollywood tries to wander into areas of technology, the basic premise of the movie is just totally unrealistic. There’s no way the computing power available on a submarine would be sufficient to house an actual Artificial Intelligence. Also, at the bottom of the sea there’s no bloody connection to be used for taking over the world unless you count low frequency submarine communication which would make an old 300 baud telephone modem look lightning fast.
 
 Yes I ment baud, not bps, in that last sentence by the way.
 
 Apart from those really annoying faults the movie was, as I wrote pretty good. The special effects were over the top of course but not so totally over the top as in some movies. Sometimes they were really dragged out until they became too much though. Like the obligatory car chase or the forever falling of a cliff train.
 
 I also have to say that Nathan being screwed over, over and over again by that bitch became tiresome rather quickly. So did Benji’s often ridiculous behavior.
 
 So 3 1/2 out of 5 stars it is. Could have been better but could also have been a lot worse.",7.0
575264,67d61828790d78633a01584d,Angel Brown,"Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise return with another high-octane installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, delivering breathtaking action, a gripping story, and a sense of urgency that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. Dead Reckoning Part One is not just a typical spy thriller; it’s a showcase of practical stunts, sharp storytelling, and an evolving narrative that sets the stage for the franchise’s most ambitious chapter yet.
 
 The film follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team—Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson)—as they go up against a new, ominous threat: an advanced artificial intelligence known as ""The Entity."" With a rogue key holding control over this AI, Ethan races against time to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, all while being pursued by a relentless assassin (Esai Morales) and facing the return of former ally-turned-rival, Gabriel.
 
 What sets Dead Reckoning Part One apart is its ability to balance large-scale action with emotional stakes. Tom Cruise once again defies the limits of human endurance, executing jaw-dropping stunts—including a now-iconic motorcycle jump off a cliff. Meanwhile, the ensemble cast shines, with standout performances from Hayley Atwell as Grace, a mysterious thief drawn into the chaos, and Pom Klementieff as a deadly adversary.
 
 The action sequences are among the franchise's best, particularly a tension-filled train sequence that rivals any set piece in modern action cinema. Lorne Balfe’s intense score amplifies the stakes, while the cinematography captures stunning global locations, from Venice to Abu Dhabi.
 
 If there’s one drawback, it’s that the film is only part one of a larger story, leaving some threads unresolved. However, the pacing, character depth, and sheer spectacle make it a worthy entry in the Mission: Impossible saga. With a thrilling finale that sets up Part Two, this film cements the franchise’s reputation as one of the best in action cinema.
 
 Rating: ★★★★½ (4.5/5)",9.0
575264,681e373a6c7881d1c40b3092,Brent Western,"First, let’s address the obvious. Tom Cruise definitely has a type. Every single romantic interest or possible romantic interest in these movies are always brunettes. Every single potential foil, foe or enemy is always blonde. Don’t know if there’s more to it than that, but it’s something I’ve noticed over the years.
 
 The movie started off a bit odd with an opening sequence that really doesn’t get explained until halfway through the movie. Your left wondering if you miss something for the first 30 minutes of the movie. The usual names and faces are there and you can feel the comfort with the character as you settle in to watch the first half of the finale.
 
 One of the so-called twist about halfway through the movie was so obvious that I was surprised they followed through with it. Sad to see a character go to go in the way that they did.
 
 
 Also, as a sidenote, I’m disappointed Michelle Monahan doesn’t make an appearance in this or the final movie. With the amount of times that she’s been found, wouldn’t she have been better off staying with Ethan than doing all of these spy tactics just to be found anyway anyways?
 
 
 Even though the action sequences were great, they weren’t as adventurous or extreme as they have been in previous movies. Not to take away from what they were or the people who performed them, it just didn’t have the same level of excitement and suspense as some of the others did.
 
 
 Any two part movie always seems to fall flat, because the first part is always setting up the second part. It’s no different here, but I’m looking forward to finishing the saga as we approach the second part of the finale.",7.0
575264,682e800a1b03ca4b1c63f348,r96sk,"<em>'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning'</em> is a fun M:I movie, certainly. Admittedly, I am someone - despite enjoying all of them to a fairly solid degree - who has a relatively lukewarm feeling for these flicks, at least compared to other franchises.
 
 These go in one ear and out the other if I'm totally honest. That does sound negative, but it honestly isn't because I certainly have the desired entertainment with 'em whilst watching; they just don't stick in the old memory bank, that's all. That's arguably by design, no? Perhaps that part is harsh.
 
 This seventh entry does set things up nicely for the currently-in-theaters sequel, which I am looking forward to. The action, stunts, cast and music are the big strengths pf this series and those departments are practically perfected here, that theme song will forever be iconic.
 
 Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, a performance of quality as one would expect. Hayley Atwell is a great addition, while it's nice to see Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg again. The rest of those onscreen are impressive as well, namely Pom Klementieff and Esai Morales.
 
 I'm not sure this needed to be split in two with that noted follow-up, but I guess the proof will be in the pudding when I hopefully watch that 2025 release soon. I'm positive it'll be fun to see, either way.",8.0

The war of Kens during the last half hour of the film is an all-timer because a battle full of handsome maneuvers, like showing off their naked chest and manly noogies, turns into a full on dance off between Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu.
 
 But the second half of the film leaves a thought-provoking message in your brain regarding both men and women. The Kens gaining respect little by little mirrors how women eventually earned their rights to be respected individuals — after being considered as only being useful in the kitchen or for making babies — except with the gender roles reversed and nude blobs instead of genitalia.

 ""Barbie is hilariously meta, containing spectacularly funny musical numbers, and an efficient tonal balance between over-the-top comedy and rich, thought-provoking social commentary. Inevitable awards are on the way for the brightly colored production design, costumes, and makeup.
 
 Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach's narrative unapologetically tackles quite serious topics, from sociopolitical matters like patriarchy and sexual harassment to questions about existential crises, personal identity, self-love, and, of course, the roles of women and men in today's society.
 
 Margot Robbie was destined to play Barbie just as Ryan Gosling was born with Kenergy in his veins. Absolutely fantastic, as are the rest of the Barbies and Kens.

346698,64c0e3f6ede1b000c8bcc273,CinemaSerf,"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",7.0
346698,64c4e33dcadb6b01066cb4b9,JP Hastings-Spital,"This was an _excellent_ film that left me emotionally stretched in just the right way. It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!) It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.
 
 The writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role — especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.
 
 It's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see. It's _hard_ to watch, as a man—feeling responsible for so many challenges women face—but Barbie doesn't judge, it voices. It's a message that informs me, helps me, as well as entertaining me, but it isn't meant for _me_; the extent to which Yvette felt seen, understood and perfectly spoken on behalf of _is_ this movie, and why it deserves all the praise it's getting.

346698,64c5b2b1cadb6b00ac65b2ba,Brent Marchant,"“Heavy is the arm that wears its heart on its sleeve.” That’s the best way to sum up this overwritten, overlong, stunningly obvious treatise on gender equality, consumerism and existentialism, whose messages get beaten to death beginning early on and never let up, an exhausting experience, to be sure. Writer-director Greta Gerwig’s latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that’s about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What’s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like “writing” than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, “Barbie” does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I’ll easily forget before year’s end – and one that conclusively proves the power of marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.",5.0

 Its social message should not be controversial — _Barbie_ is a _critique of power and status quo_. 
 
 Its allegory in art swings at every in-power group, and gives voice to every marginalized group.
 
 There's even a point at which Barbie longs to restore the status quo in Barbieland and return to her position of privilege, and is chastised by Ken who, having reversed the roles, asks her ""how does it feel?"" (to be not seen, to not matter).
 
 _Barbie_ illustrated clearly that _the status quo hurts everyone, including those in power_ — in other words, challenging the status quo is good for men as well as woman (and insert every other power dynamic here  — able-bodied as well as mobility-challenged, rich as well as poor, etc.)
 
 That its social message is controversial proves its necessity. The only way this critique on power and status quo could be misconstrued as an attack on men is if people think power and control of the status quo belong only to men — which, eureka! is precisely what this movie is speaking to.

 I steer clear of as much film promo as possible, so was kinda expecting this to be more of a 'proper' comedy - just an assumption on my part. It does have humour but it's far from the film's main thing, there are a few chucklesome moments but I found it to be more earnest than funny.
 
 It does get a tiny bit moralistic, though undoubtedly has the right intentions and does certainly hit the nail on the head with certain points. The story itself is interesting, I like that they didn't lean deep into the usual fish out of water stuff when Barbie visits the real world. I enjoy how the world is set, with the multiple Barbies and Kens etc.
 
 The cast are great. Margot Robbie is top notch - the perfect choice. Ryan Gosling is excellent as well, while America Ferrera, Will Ferrell and Michael Cera are positives too.

 My feelings were somewhat ambivalent before watching ""Barbie"". Due to my admiration for Greta Gerwig's films and her personal work, I had high expectations. However, the comprehensive marketing of ""Barbie"" had me concerned that it might fall into the trap of consumerist pseudo-feminism and face backlash from the public.
 
 
 But I must say, this film truly exceeded my expectations!
 
 Perhaps many people watched ""Barbie"" for the nostalgia of their childhood, but this movie is not about creating a pure and nostalgic atmosphere like ""Toy Story"". It is a profound and highly modern film with a thought-provoking core, marking a breakthrough for Hollywood in commercial films with feminist themes. Its narrative remains closely linked to various issues in modern society. While it includes the passionate declarations and satirical commentary on patriarchy often seen in feminist films, it also sincerely attempts to build bridges for dialogue between genders and among the same gender.
 
 
 This is particularly evident in its depiction of ""patriarchy"" and the ""male gaze.""
 
 **What is patriarchy?**
 
 
 The answer presented by the film is that patriarchy does not necessarily refer to a society solely ruled by men. The essence of patriarchy lies in the imbalance of power structures, thus any society where one party dominates or suppresses the discourse of another is an embodiment of patriarchy. The film conveys this through the contrasting portrayal of Barbieland, which represents a matriarchal society, and Kendom, which represents a patriarchal society, as well as the power struggles between the two and their resulting consequences. In Barbieland, the Barbies have absolute dominance in social, political, economic, and cultural aspects. The night festivities always belong to the Barbies, while Kens merely serve as props. On the other hand, Ken, after experiencing the baptism of the real world (the true patriarchy society), immediately becomes more patriarchal and transforms Barbieland into Kendom, adopting the patriarchal system of the real world. The power dynamics are thus reversed, and the Barbies become mere servants to the Kens. However, whether it is Ken in Barbieland or Barbie in Kendom, both are unable to express themselves freely. They both inevitably become objectified beings, seeking their own worth through the validation of others. This is because the web of power restricts subjectivity and is independent of gender. Anyone, regardless of gender, can be the perpetrator of patriarchy, and anyone, regardless of gender, can be a victim of patriarchy. This exploration sets the film apart from many mainstream movies that fail to delve into the complexities of patriarchy.
 
 
 That being said, the climactic scene where the Barbies reclaim political power seems to suggest that female governance is stronger than solely male governance, but with the need for certain modifications. However, upon watching it only once, I am not entirely certain about this point.
 
 **Reproduction of the Four Gazes of Gender**
 
 
 It can be said that the film industry has always been built upon the male gaze, while the female gaze has gradually become familiar with the progress of society and the increasing influence of women in consumer culture. However, the male gaze often found in films is directed towards sexualized female characters, especially evident in the visual language. Similarly, the female gaze is based on the objectification of male characters from the perspective of female viewers. In contrast, the discussion of male gaze towards other males or female gaze towards other females, and the impacts they generate, are rarely brought up in public discourse.
 
 
 These four dimensions of gender gaze are represented to varying degrees in the film ""Barbie"". In Barbieland, the Kens are the objects of gaze and are in a passive position both physically and mentally. After experiencing the privileges brought by patriarchy for males in the real world, Ken projects his inner desires and fantasies onto successful male figures in reality, ultimately achieving self-identification with these masculine qualities by establishing Kendom. The Barbies in Kendom, including Barbie herself portrayed by Robbie, and the peculiar gaze directed towards them when they enter the real world, represent the reproduction of the male gaze. The Barbies in Barbieland may appear carefree and glamorous, but they still hold certain underlying consensus regarding ""beauty"". That is why Barbie becomes so alarmed when she discovers that her feet are no longer in the shape of high heels but can fully touch the ground, or when her skin develops cellulitis instead of remaining smooth. This also explains why the unconventional and eccentric Barbie advocating female liberation and freedom is initially excluded from the mainstream in Barbieland, only to be eventually accepted at the end.
 
 **Non-stereotypical Feminism in Barbie**
 
 
 The third highlight of this film lies in its unconventional expression of feminism, primarily manifested through the construction and subsequent shattering of Barbieland, which breaks away from the clichés of commercial films representing female themes, such as those centered around young girls.
 
 
 Postfeminism emerged in the 1980s as a critique and reflection on the waves of the second-wave feminist movement. It is not a singular school of thought, but rather encompasses a broad concept containing various voices. According to feminist scholar Angela McRobbie, postfeminism overly emphasizes individual choices, which hinders the understanding of gender's structural role and impact, thereby weakening the force of social change. Furthermore, in the context of the ""sheconomy,"" postfeminism's endorsement of consumerism also poses the danger of reducing feminism to a commodity or marketing strategy. This, in turn, obstructs people from acknowledging the real challenges faced by women in economic, political, and social spheres. From this perspective, the film's portrayal of Barbieland and the lifestyles and states of the Barbies in the early stages carries a strong sense of postfeminism.
 
 
 Surprisingly, the film ingeniously transitions to Barbie crossing over into the real world and embarking on a series of explorations regarding gender, emotions, life, and death. This breaks the singular fantasy that Barbie and female viewers may have about Barbieland, preventing the story from becoming a mindless action flick. The film not only advocates for body diversity and inclusivity in women but also delves deeply into Barbie's journey of personal growth, showcasing how she transforms from an innocent and simple assembly line doll into a fully realized human being with genuine emotions and a strong sense of self-will. In this regard, ""Barbie"" truly reconstructs the meaning of Barbie, imbuing its feminism with a more enriching and sincere undertone.
 
 **Intriguing Plot and Character Designs**
 
 
 Proactively deconstructing oneself
 Two particularly memorable scenes stand out in this regard. First, Margot Robbie's Barbie, in a self-deprecating manner, criticizes her own appearance while others hurriedly try to console her. Suddenly, a voice-over interjects, implying that even the director chose Margot Robbie to play the role of Barbie, making the self-critique less convincing (laughs). The second scene involves the CEO of the Barbie manufacturer rejecting the film's mom character's passionate plea for aesthetic diversity in Barbie's production. However, as soon as his subordinate suggests that this approach could be highly profitable, he immediately changes his stance, simultaneously mocking capitalism and poking fun at himself.
 
 Filming war scenes
 This film is packed with entertaining plot twists and visuals, one of which includes a chaotic gathering of Ken soldiers amidst Kendom's disarray. Greta transforms the typical war scene, filled with sword fights and rivers of blood, into a lively and adorable virtual pet brawl, showcasing her unique and imaginative approach.
 
 Allan's character design
 The design of the character Allan is also quite intriguing. In a Barbieland where all males are named Ken and all females are named Barbie, where gender traits and boundaries are distinct, Allan stands out as a one-of-a-kind existence, defying any specific gender definition, be it in name, personality, or appearance. This adds a touch of queerness to the film.
 
 Homage to various works
 ""Barbie"" pays homage to several classic films, showcasing their imaginative style. Examples include the opening sequence reminiscent of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the choice between two pills reminiscent of ""The Matrix,"" and the dance choreography of the Ken characters during the civil war, which nods to ""Singing in the Rain"" (Greta has expressed her love for this film in multiple interviews, showing genuine appreciation!).
 
 ""I want to see a gynecologist""
 Initially, the significance of this final line may be unclear, but thanks to explanations from online users, it becomes apparent. Barbie, originally a doll devoid of human reproductive organs, mentioning a gynecologist implies that she now has a vagina. The desire to visit a gynecologist can be seen as her way of exploring and understanding herself as a human being.
 
 When it comes to flaws in this film, one could argue that the pacing of the narrative is too fast, at times feeling abrupt, such as in the resolution of the mother-daughter conflict. However, one could also argue that this is a deliberate choice driven by its commercial nature, and in a way, it aligns with the film's whimsical and imaginative style.
 
 
 One scene in particular deeply touched me, and that is the ending where Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, and Barbie herself transcend the barriers of time and space to come face to face once again. The elderly Handler gazes tenderly at the doll she once single-handedly brought to life, encouraging her to bravely explore the possibilities of life and accompany her through the final stage of her awakening. In this seemingly frozen moment, the love they share flows gently in the soft whispers of Billie Eilish.
 
 
 In the end, both Ken and Barbie find their own purpose and value, and through their individual journeys of growth, the film constructs a vision of an ideal world:
 
 
 In this world,
 
 
 everyone has the right and courage to be themselves.
 
 
 In this world,
 
 
 It’s not Barbie and Ken，
 
 
 It’s not Ken and Barbie，
 
 
 It’s Barbie and it’s Ken。",

 In my opinion, this movie was well-executed, striking a balance between fantasy and reality. ""Barbie"" takes viewers on an exhilarating journey, bringing the beloved doll and cartoon character to life in a spectacular live-action adaptation.
 
 Margot Robbie shines in her role as Barbie, delivering a fantastic performance alongside a talented cast. While there were a few questionable choices in terms of casting, such as introducing a transgender Barbie character, it did not detract from the overall appeal of the film. While it may have caused some confusion among viewers, the movie's charm remained intact.
 
 America Ferrera delivers a powerful and empowering monologue in the film, showcasing her incredible talent and versatility as an actress. Her transition from ""Ugly Betty"" to this role is commendable, and she truly stands out in the movie.
 
 ""Barbie"" is a fun and quirky film that may not be suitable for very young children or those who prefer to shield their kids from certain themes in movies. It offers an over-the-top experience that may not be everyone's cup of tea.

On the one hand, it has inconsistent suspense, has dodgy humour and doesn't truly entertain like an action thriller ought to. On the other hand, the performances are good, the exterior plane shots are convincing and the twisty nature makes it watchable.
 
 Mark Wahlberg (amusing accent), Michelle Dockery and Topher Grace are actors that I enjoyed watching here, Grace manages to overcome some cringey dialogue that was (hopefully, for his sake) written for him; the banter isn't great, the more serious stuff he is solid at. Monib Abhat also has iffy comedy, though does make it work more; a mostly voice role helps.
 
 Overall, a fine time at the movies. Like last week, I was fortunately able to watch it as part of a double header on the big screen - this time with Steven Soderbergh's <em>'Presence'</em>.

The first few shots in the cabin pull you in, and the takeoff sequence gives some nice scenic visuals. But once the plane gets in the air, the movie loses its edge. The direction is competent but lacks any real flair, shifting into a standard back-and-forth between characters that makes everything feel predictable. The plot tries to build tension with espionage and intrigue, but it never fully develops. There are a lot of questionable decisions made by the characters, and the script doesn’t do much to make them feel believable.
 
 Mark Wahlberg delivers a solid performance, holding his character well, but the supporting cast doesn’t bring much to the table. The CGI is a weak point, especially considering how much the movie relies on it. With most of the story taking place inside the plane, you'd expect at least the exterior shots to be convincing, but they aren't.

It awkwardly straddles the line between brainless action flick and tense, claustrophobic thriller, failing miserably at both. The overall writing is a disaster, with dialogue so wooden that even the most mundane conversations feel like an endurance test. The pacing is just as dreadful, with lifeless, generic interactions dragging between absurd fight sequences. In addition to the unthinkable level of suspension of disbelief, the cast is also unable to improve the appalling material.
 
 Topher Grace delivers an awful performance, while Michelle Dockery and Mark Wahlberg - who admittedly commits to his lunatic role - can't escape the movie's overwhelming ridiculousness. Wahlberg's bald head and absurd dialogue make it impossible to take him seriously. But the real disappointment is Mel Gibson, whose direction is incomprehensibly dull. For the man behind Braveheart and Hacksaw Ridge, this is an embarrassingly uninspired effort. Adding insult to injury, the film's noticeable green screen and atrocious VFX make everything look cheap and artificial.

138843,539f8d2e0e0a2650810003e5,John Chard,"It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.
 
 The key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about ""nothing new on the table"" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.
 
 There's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that ""haunt"" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.
 
 Forget the ""based on a true story"" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means ""this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit"". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.
 
 Story essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.
 
 There is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.
 
 The script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.

138843,539fdb9dc3a36850d9000ef5,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting?
 
 This is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.
 
 One thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this “ghosthunter” make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.
 
 The we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.
 
 Anyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.",7.0

James Wan really does develop this story with an effective degree of menace and Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor work well together as the parents scared out of their pants by the goings-on in their dream home that is turning into a nightmare that perhaps even an exorcism won't resolve. Joseph Bishara presents us with an eerily effective musical accompaniment to this story and the acrobatic and prosthetic visual effects all contribute effectively to create a real sense of malevolence that, unusually for many in this genre - it has a degree of plausibility too.

 It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares either, which is something I was expecting it to utilise. The supernatural elements here are very well done, we don't see terribly much of the demons, at least early on, so any appearances are effective. The stuff with the kids/mum is convincing too.
 
 I was happy to see Vera Farmiga appear onscreen, I remember her fondly from 2011's <em>'Source Code'</em> and have wanted to see her in lead roles since - she's excellent in this. Patrick Wilson and Lili Taylor are also notable performers, while Joey King has one particularly great scene.

896536,68097b63c5c8035fb08aebf7,Chris Sawin,"An animal species known as the ochi have been attacking people, destroying crops, and causing general destruction to a remote village on the small island of Carpathia. Maxim (Willem Dafoe) has taken it upon himself to lead every young boy on the island to hunt and kill the ochi before their chaotic conduct ruins any more Carpathian livelihoods.
 
 Maxim’s daughter Yuri (Helena Zengel, News of the World) doesn’t share her father’s kill or be killed rational towards the ochi. So when Yuri discovers a wounded baby ochi she takes it upon herself to take him home even though she has to risk her life to do so.
 
 The Legend of Ochi is the first feature film from Isaiah Saxon. Saxon was a character designer for Marcel the Shell with Shoes On and writes, directs, and produces The Legend of the Ochi. The fantasy adventure film was shot in Transylvania, the Apuseni Mountains, Balea Lake, on the Transfagarasan road, and in Romania. The film utilizes in-camera puppetry, animatronics, CGI, and matte paintings while the baby ochi was a puppet operated by seven performers. The Legend of Ochi had a modest $10 million budget.
 
 The screening of the film saw a short introduction by Isaiah Saxon stating that the majority of the effects in the film regarding the ochi being brought to life on-screen were all done in-camera and that the film took six years to make. Six years seems like a really long time to make a film like this even with Saxon performing triple duty on the film.
 
 The ochi are, for the most part, a marvelous aspect of the film. They look phenomenal and the baby ochi is adorable. He looks as if somebody threw a monkey, Gizmo from Gremlins, and Grogu from The Mandalorian in a blender. Everything being done in-camera mostly pays off as the ochi never look like they weren’t there interacting with the actors.
 
 David Longstreth’s score is the boisterous MVP of the film. The music of the film is always booming with bellowing strings and makes every cinematic sequence and every plot point of the film feel like the film’s most pivotal aspect solely because of how grandiose and superb the soundtrack is.
 
 Evan Prosofsky’s cinematography is also a valuable asset to the film. The Legend of Ochi is a very grainy film leading one to believe that it was either shot on film or filtered in a way to make it look that way. The film is gushing with beautiful scenery featuring majestic forests and snow-capped mountain tops. The matte painting aspect isn’t surprising as several backdrops look like they were painted, but also adds to that in-the-middle-of-nowhere beauty the film embraces from the start.
 
 But that’s where The Legend of Ochi will likely divide audiences. While the puppetry is mostly an extremely welcome part of the film, you never really believe that the ochi aren’t just puppets. The way they move or don’t move (the baby ochi’s hand has no life whatsoever despite several close-ups) isn’t entirely natural or is done in a way that seems to be hiding performers.
 
 The story feels like you’ve experienced it before. Yuri’s interactions with the baby ochi are straight out of E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. Meanwhile, Maxim’s desire to slaughter the Ochi while Yuri has a desire to help them and let their species flourish is straight out of How to Train Your Dragon; Yuri’s mother Dasha (Emily Watson), even similarly abandons Maxim and Yuri as Hiccup’s mother Valka. Its slow pace and colorful visuals also give The Legend of Ochi a slight Wes Anderson vibe.
 
 There isn’t an ending to the film. Instead, the credits roll right when Yuri finishes what she set out to do. There’s probably a bit more to it than that like something about two families being reunited and becoming one, but it isn’t entirely satisfying. Apart from a few leg injuries in The Legend of Ochi, nothing tragic occurs. Yuri thinks Maxim is dumb and wants to spend all her time with this weird little hairy thing she just made. Maxim is kind of dumb with his Don Quixote armor and insistence on singing along to everything that comes on the radio except for death metal.
 
 For the most part, The Legend of Ochi is a magical adventure brimming with wonder. The film has a terrific score and the puppeteering is solid. But the film lacks character development (Finn Wolfhard is in this for no reason) or a proper resolution and the story collapses on itself thanks to its simplistic nature.",7.0

""Lilo"" is facing some domestic turbulence at the hands of social worker ""Bubbles"" but ""Stitch"" is still determined to make their lives interesting and, if necessary, use the people to protect him from the pursuing agents of the ""Galactic Federation"". The underlying moralising is all the same as usual - teamwork, loneliness, love and the values of family and sharing, but Dean DeBlois manages to dress that all up cleverly with plenty of enjoyable escapades, some frequently pithy one-liners and even the slightest hint of menace from the Grand Councilwoman who must have been inspired by Glenn Close! I didn't love the style of animation, too much eyes - but the colours and general look of the film are vibrant and the characters are engaging til the end.",7.0
496243,5d060140c3a36832f220dedd,SWITCH.,"What makes ‘Parasite’ so satisfying is that it commits neither error. It’s an engrossing, stylish and near perfect movie, and its underlying themes go beyond merely pointing out class exploitation to challenge the logic of capital. Though he is often juggling a mosaic of characters, themes and social issues, Bong never eschews his anarchic impulses and dark humour. It’s a movie that should be seen as widely as possible, if only so that Bong Joon-ho gets more chances to make movies for modern audiences that badly need them.

496243,5daaf2d59661fc001241a1d8,Sheldon Nylander,"The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo’s, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.
 
 This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn’t shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don’t feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience’s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.
 
 However, I do say it’s MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we’ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn’t feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren’t surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!
 
 Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It’s a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don’t spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don’t have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn’t essential to it.
 
 This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don’t see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I’ve seen in 2019. Highly recommended!",10.0

 News that Adam McCay is collaborating with Bong Joon Ho to retool Parasite as a Netflix series makes me positively giddy. Parasite is easily the best movie I've seen since the Big Short. Joon Ho's compelling ease of execution alongside the effortless lure of the plot's trappings had me hooked in an instant. I would have been happy watching this family fold pizza boxes for two hours. The story, like the family, takes on a life of its own, rapidly elevating to a setup impossible to sustain. The Bunuelesque occupy-the-rich scheme gleefully, blissfully ascends to lofty heights only, inevitably, to hit the fatal fan. The poor buggers ultimately find themselves literally chin deep in their own sh*t. The hotsy-totsy aristocrats, meanwhile, host a lovely garden party that flips into a tragic Shakespearean bloodbath. It's all fun and games till someone loses a daughter. (Note to the rich: Check the references of new hires and think twice before inviting riffraff to your afternoon functions). Decades in the making, the implosion of a middle income buffer and a widening disparity between social classes make Parasite a must-see for all income brackets. You don't have to be rich or detest or envy the rich to enjoy this instant classic. But please, whatever you do, don't try this a home, folks. Never combine the rich and poor without safety goggles or outside the confines of a controlled and supervised laboratory setting.",10.0

 'Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.
 
 I admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'Parasite' proves it.
 
 The movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.
 
 The performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout.
 
 I highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.

 Yes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.
 
 In addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm ""following the pack"". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!
 
 It can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.
 
 There's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.
 
 It's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought ""this is too much, this would never occur"". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.
 
 Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.
 
 Technically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.
 
 All in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I ""should"" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...

 >_We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service – two dishes, but to one table._
 
 - William Shakespeare; _The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke_, 4.iii.23-24 (1599-1601)
 
 What is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define _Gisaengchung_ [_Parasite_]? Only the third film to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, after Billy Wilder's _The Lost Weekend_ (1945) and Delbert Mann's _Marty_ (1955), _Parasite_ is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon-ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night – four (Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay). On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.
 
 But what exactly is _Parasite_? Described on its official website as a ""_pitch-black modern fairy-tale_"", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature – part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that's just the opening scene! It's the _Ulysses_ of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like _Ulysses_, it's exceptional in just about every way – screenplay (co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, _mise en scène_, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things – it lives up to the hype.
 
 The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. And so, hiding the fact that they're all related, Ki-taek is hired as a chauffeur, Chung-Sook as a housekeeper, and Ki-jeong as an art therapist for Da-song. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.
 
 We live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots is wider than ever. According to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth. At the same time, adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the _milieu_ of _Parasite_, a film which taps into some of the same ideological thinking as gave rise to ""_Hell Joseon_"" sentiments, wherein up to 75% of Koreans aged 19-34 want to leave the country. 
 
 Obviously enough, Bong's main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth – the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and batshit insane third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that's about as different from the film's early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, touching obliquely on similar themes in _Sarinui Chueok_ [_Memories of Murder_] (2003), _Gwoemul_ [_The Host_] (2006), and _Madeo_ [_Mother_] (2009). _Parasite_'s engagement with class and economics, however, is far more overt, aligning it with Bong's English-language work, _Snowpiercer_ (2013) and _Okja_ (2015). Never before, however, has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed, _Parasite_ feels like a culmination, the film to which he's been building for his entire career.
 
 In the film's press notes, Bong states;
 
 >_I think that one way to portray the continuing polarisation and inequality of our society is as a sad comedy. We are living in an era when capitalism is the reigning order, and we have no other alternative. It's not just in Korea, but the entire world faces a situation where the tenets of capitalism cannot be ignored. In the real world, the paths of families like our four unemployed protagonists and the Park family are unlikely ever to cross. The only instance is in matters of employment between classes, as when someone is hired as a tutor or a domestic worker. In such cases there are moments when the two classes come into close enough proximity to feel each other's breath. In this film, even though there is no malevolent intention either side, the two classes are pulled into a situation where the slightest slip can lead to fissures and eruptions. In today's capitalistic society there are ranks and castes that are invisible to the eye. We keep them disguised and out of sight, and superficially look down on class hierarchies as a relic of the past, but the reality is that there are class lines that cannot be crossed._
 
 In this manner, the film works as a literalisation of the theory that co-existence between the various classes is becoming increasingly difficult; the Kims and the Parks aren't simply differentiated due to wealth, rather they live in completely different worlds and have vastly different, and largely incompatible, ideologies.
 
 One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong's avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics – the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it's the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families – obsessed with their mobile phones and WhatsApp, we first meet them as they're wandering around their apartment, phones held aloft, trying to pick up their neighbour's WiFi signal. Later, as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect. 
 
 There are no heroes and villains here – Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot; Da-hye and Da-song rarely leave their rooms, Yeon-gyo spends most of her time in the kitchen and living room, and Dong-ik is seen most regularly in his car. It's a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect – this is a filmmaker who knows precisely what he's doing.
 
 It's in relation to the two family's status as heroes or villains that the film's title is so important. Strictly speaking, the Korean title, ""_기생충_"" (""gisaengchung""), means ""helminth"" rather than ""parasite"", but as a helminth is a parasitic worm, the slight difference in the translation isn't a big deal. In any case, a parasitic organism such as a helminth lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren't that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well – they've been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship. Concerning this issue, in his Director's Statement, Bong says,
 
 >_it is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. In the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites? It's not that they were parasites from the start. They are our neighbours, friends and colleagues, who have merely been pushed to the edge of a precipice._
 
 However, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot Lee Chang-dong's superb _Beoning_ (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' and Parks' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.
 
 It's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how much of a masterwork this is, how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre (think James Ivory's _The Remains of the Day_ or Robert Altman's _Gosford Park_), Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their stagnation and inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks' lavish home has two main stairways – one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he's suddenly directing a horror film (there's a thematic reason for this that I can't go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There's also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which has huge narrative and thematic importance.
 
 _Parasite_ is a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie – a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich – but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant, and allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art; it's the best Palme d'Or winner since Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_ in 2011 and the best Best Picture winner since Kevin Costner's _Dances with Wolves_ in 1990. Bong is currently working with HBO to develop a limited series English-language adaptation, which fills me with dread, but no matter what happens with that project, no matter how good (or bad) it may be, here in 2020, Parasite has proven itself very much a game-changer, a film that deserves every bit of praise it's received.",9.0

 No doubt about it, <em>'Parasite'</em> is a high quality film. It wasn't at all what I had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting - and that's a positive. Yet, it's still pretty dark. It's a great mix. The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts.
 
 The cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet. Song Kang-ho would be my personal standout, I enjoyed watching him throughout. Choi Woo-shik is very good too, as are Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. All of the onscreen talent do terrific though, from Cho Yeo-jeong to Lee Jung-eun.

 ""Fountain of Youth is a prime example of how to craft quality, crowd-pleasing entertainment without reinventing the wheel. Is it predictable? Absolutely. Formulaic? No doubt.
 
 But it’s undeniably fun, visually engaging, and driven by a charismatic cast and a director who knows exactly what he’s doing. Guy Ritchie brings his trademark energy without betraying the genre’s core identity, and James Vanderbilt delivers a solid, compelling script.
 
 It’s a shame the film didn’t get the theater release it deserved – like the ancient sites it explores, it should have been experienced in all its grandeur.""

1098006,6835fa592f025fa43a730497,Brent Western,"I came into this movie hearing that it wasn’t all that was cracked up to be, that it was a bit lifeless and a paint by numbers movie. I can’t really dispute that. But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.
 
 There isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.
 
 There are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.
 
 The story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.
 
 This will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards. Still it entertained me for the two hours it was on and at this point, that’s all I’m looking for in movies.",8.0
402431,6740dd1d68823004ca9c639d,Chris Sawin,"The film adaptation of Wicked is based on the Broadway musical, which is a loose adaptation of the 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire. Both Maguire’s novel and the musical are expansions of L. Frank Baum’s original The Wizard of Oz novel was published in 1900 and its film adaptation in 1939. The musical is one of the longest-running and financially successful Broadway musicals of all time.
 
 With a screenplay by Winnie Holzman (writer of the book of the Wicked musical) and Dana Fox (Cruella) and directed by Jon M. Chu (Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians), Wicked begins around the time The Wizard of Oz ends. The Wicked Witch of the West has died and Glinda the Good Witch is breaking the news to Munchkinland. As the munchkins celebrate and burn a giant, Wicker Man-style witch in celebration of the witch’s death, Glinda is asked by one of the munchkins if she knew the witch.
 
 What follows is nearly three hours of how a green-skinned, outcast girl named Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) whose emotions spark wondrous fits of unbelievable magic interacts with the spoiled, entitled, and pink-infatuated Galinda (Ariana Grande) as they enroll in a magic school known as Shiz University.
 
 Visually, Wicked is jaw-dropping and beautiful. All of the talking animals look extraordinary and every sequence with the flying monkeys is a visual highlight. Peter Dinklage voices a goat teacher named Dr. Dillamond and he has one of the most emotional arcs in the film. The bear nurse and dog doctor in the opening moments of the film look so good for what little amount of screen time they have.
 
 Given how many VFX teams are credited in the film, it’s no wonder the CGI looks intricately gorgeous. The three VFX teams with the most credits in Wicked include OPSIS (The Fall Guy, Rescue Rangers), Framestore (Gladiator II, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice), and ILM (Venom: The Last Dance, Alien: Romulus). Then there’s various work from about a dozen different other VFX teams/houses, but the most intriguing one is one called FoyProAI.
 
 FoyProAI doesn’t have an accessible official website, but some digging around on an executive producer’s LinkedIn page gives some background. Foy stands for Fountains of Youth and FoyProAI specializes in de-aging, up-aging, and beauty work in film. They’ve worked on Smile 2, John Woo’s The Killer for Peacock, and 400 shots on Wicked.
 
 There are moments of greatness in Wicked that mostly stem from the chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Grande’s comedic roots, specifically her time and experience on SNL, really come into play here. Grande is essentially the comedic relief as Galinda as her outgoing personality carries most sequences while Erivo has more of a straightforward performance that has more of a dry delivery.
 
 But the generic musical formula is infuriating. Story beats pause and go out of their way to cater to multiple songs at times and it logically hurts your brain. Yes, it’s a musical and yes people are going to sing. But when the main characters are trying to get away on a flying broom as guards are pounding at the door and they spend another ten minutes dancing, crying, and bellowing about their broken friendship it becomes a nuisance. Get on the damn broom and sing on the way to your destination. It doesn’t seem that hard.
 
 Some sequences are thrown in solely because they’ll make a big song more appealing (the whole rotating library straight out of Inception thing) or side stories that don’t go anywhere because two characters need to seem closer than they are (Elphaba and Fiyero’s awkward ten-minute excursion into the forest to free a lion cub). These are both roundabout executions that take the long way to showcase that Fiyero thinks reading is dumb and that he’s actually in love with Elphaba over Galinda.
 
 The film adaptation seems like it’s quite faithful to its source material, but the Hollywood concept of transforming nasty and recognizable villains into sad, relatable characters that the audience roots for is a dumpster fire of a concept. Pure asshole villains can be fantastic too and often make protagonists more interesting if done right.
 
 But the musical fantasy film treats Elphaba like dirt for the first hour and a half. Everyone looks down on her because of the color of her skin. Then when she finally becomes friends with Galinda, she develops a soft spot for mistreated animals. It’s the main reason she turns against The Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) apart from being one of the only characters who can read magic spells.
 
 Wicked is Mean Girls at Hogwarts as everybody sucks and is superficial apart from a character that is supposed to be evil. Elphaba mostly accepts the role of wicked witch because her beliefs don’t match anyone else’s and she’s unwilling to adapt to their ways solely to keep the peace.
 
 Wicked features some unreal VFX and even touches on some incredible ideas from time to time, but the ideas that work seem to stem from capitalizing on a fantasy world that was established over a century ago. As a film, Wicked conjures song after song and drags on and on solely because it’s a bloated musical that wants you to die a rhythmic, sometimes undecipherable, high-pitched death.",2.0

 I've been a Wicked fan since 2010. My expectations for this film were extremely high! And I was blown away by how Jon M. Chu was able to bring this story a new life. Everyone involved did an excellent job! The choice to sing live paid off! Not one note was out of tune! Bowen Yang & Bronwyn James were absolutely hilarious as Phannee & Shen Shen. Marissa Bode was fantastic as Nessarose. Can't wait to see her story continue in Part 2. I hope they include ""Wicked Witch of the East"" in the Part 2 Soundtrack. Ethan Slater was great as Boq. I'm excited to see how he becomes the Tin Man in Part 2 because that's not shown on stage. He transforms behind the cabinet but I hope we actually see it in Part 2. Michelle Yeoh was great in every scene as Madam Morrible. She was very Wicked! Jeff Goldblum was amazing as The Wizard! I loved the new version of The Grimmerie! The way it opened was very cool! Jonathan Bailey was incredibly charming as Fiyero! Dancing Through Life was very well choreographed and his singing was great! Loved the way he met Elphaba in this version. I'm very intrigued to see him become The Scarecrow in Part 2. Ariana Grande was absolutely phenomenal as Glinda! She embodied everything about Glinda! Loved her homages to past Glindas in Popular. Her voice was very Angelic. You can tell that she studied a lot for this role. Can't wait to hear her ""I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)"". Cynthia Erivo stole the show as Elphaba Thropp. She poured her heart into this character! I'm so excited to hear ""No Good Deed"" in Part 2! She was incredible! As for the Cameos in One Short Day, Loved seeing Stephen Schwartz as The Guard & Winnie Holtzman as an Emerald City Resident. Love the expansion of the Wizomania show to include Kristin & Idina telling the story of The Grimmerie. Loved that Idina did her Elphie Battle Cry. It didn't take away from Cynthia's at the End. The Film was meant to happen in 2024. Had it come out in 2016 or 2019, I don't think it would've been as well done as it was! I can't wait to see Part 2 and how much of The Wizard of Oz they include. I hope we get to see Dorothy's Face. 10/10 No Notes.",10.0
402431,67419d0fdae2e6a93825809c,CinemaSerf,"OK, so I'm going to be swimming against the tide a bit with this, but I didn't love it. We start where the ""Wizard of Oz"" story finishes off, only without the catchy ""Ding Dong the Witch is..."". Instead we get an ensemble dance number that is energetically performed, colourful and expertly choreographed but instantly forgettable. Then we meet ""Galinda"" (Ariana Grande) who arrives in her pink bubble to confirm the news and enjoy the celebrations. Turns out, though, that she and the erstwhile ""Wicked Witch of the West"" were once friends and so back in time we go to the birth of a little green baby who may (or may not) have been conceived within the bounds of happily married wedlock. Scoot on many years more and we discover that said green person - ""Elphaba"" (Cynthia Erivo) is accompanying her wheelchair bound sister ""Nessarose"" (Marissa Bode) to the ""Ozian"" equivalent of ""Hogwarts"" where she encounters the snobbish ""Galinda"" and a fairly comprehensive degree of hostility. Luckily for her, the legendary sorceress ""Madame Morrible"" (Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden talent in this young woman and soon she is sharing rooms with her new nemesis and finding herself the butt of school jokes. Then enter the mischievous prince ""Fiyero"" (Jonathan Bailey) who tends to treat everyone the same and who's been kicked out of more schools that he can shake a sceptre at. He does, however, manage to create an environment in which everyone can get along and that's when things begin to change for an ""Elphaba"" who is to be made likeable by her now pally roomie. When a letter arrives from the all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) summoning her to the ""Emerald City"", then they set off hoping to find answers to all of their questions, only to find that nothing there is as it seems... I have to admit that JB has been a friend of mine for many years, so I ain't going to be saying anything bad about the man who might just be the next ""007"", and both Erivo and Grande do well enough with the set piece musical numbers - especially the lively and cleverly written ""Populer/lar"", but the rest of this just struck me as ""Harry Potter"" goes to the musicals where it meets ""Mean Girls"". Goldblum makes his presence felt, but in the same slightly affected fashion that he aways does, and though the visual effects are all fantastic, somehow they are all just so much more sterile to watch than when you see them within the confines of a theatrical stage - where this works so much better, and without the need for the commercially exploitative part 1 and part 2 released months apart. To be fair, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, there's a fun number from Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth and Bailey brings some much needed charm to the proceedings but I'd probably just prefer a director's cut that offered us the whole story in one three hour chunk so we can get that mediocre ""Defying Gravity"" power ballad out of the way (repeatedly) in one fell swoop. It's a very polished production, and maybe the hype has just got to me, but I can't pretend I wasn't disappointed by this. Wilted more than wicked, sorry.",7.0
402431,67436c93f3f291912e95520e,Brent Marchant,"It’s quite a rare occurrence these days when a much-anticipated film actually lives up to all of its pre-release hype, but this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical truly does so in every regard. Director Jon M. Chu has brilliantly brought to life the back story behind the lives and relationship of the two witches from the original L. Frank Baum novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 classic screen adaptation, as well as Gregory Maguire’s 1995 prequel novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. In this stunningly beautiful and delightful big-screen production, viewers learn how the supposedly evil Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) came to know the purportedly Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande-Butera), sorcery students and college roommates whose relationship initially went through a series of changes from unabashed contempt to solid friendship. However, as high-level political intrigue unfolds in their homeland of the magical land of Oz – efforts clandestinely spearheaded by the supposedly all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and university headmistress Mme. Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) – Elphaba and Glinda become unwittingly caught up in the high-stakes subterfuge playing out around them, a development that jeopardizes the future of their friendship and the stability of Oz itself. The filmmaker thus subtly but effectively presents audiences with a fable on the nature of good and evil, particularly in terms of what actually constitutes wickedness, especially when it’s skillfully veiled. The result is a thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining tale replete with stunning musical numbers, excellent choreography, ample humor, gorgeous cinematography, an inspired production design and superb performances by the four principals, all of whom are certain to be strong awards season candidates (quite a recommendation coming from someone who unapologetically makes no claim to being a fan of musicals). More than that, though, “Wicked” is an insightful treatise on the quest for power and learning how to make judicious use of it, both in personal dealings and in matters of wider consequence, a fitting cautionary tale for our times (or any time, for that matter). If I had any complaint here, it would be my concern that this is yet another example of a story that’s been divided up into two installments, a growing trend that I don’t believe will ultimately serve the movie industry well. According to the director, this was seen as a necessary step to do justice to the source material, given that it would have been nearly impossible to cram everything into one picture without doing major damage to the content. And, to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, perhaps that will ultimately prove true with the release of part 2 in 2025 (but I’ll reserve judgment on that for the time being). In the meantime, though, this first part comes through as promised, and, in this day and age, that’s a cinematic miracle in itself.",10.0
402431,674623ff9c5df08c3f1251fd,r96sk,"Very good! I enjoyed <em>'Wicked'</em>.
 
 Always impressive when a long run time flashes by - no doubt a sign of a sturdy movie. 2hr 40mins is how long this one lasts, I thought I might have felt that whilst watching but, honestly, I didn't. Since sharing my reviews online I have appreciated musicals much more, to the point that when I learn a film is from this genre it barely registers.
 
 I have never seen the stage musical, in fact the only detail I knew for certain was that it was from the world of <em>'The Wizard of Oz'</em> - which, in turn, I only know from the 1939 and 2013 movies, as well as one or two other flicks. As such, I wasn't actually sure where they were heading with the Wicked Witch of the West - but I approve.
 
 Cynthia Erivo impresses as the aforementioned. I have to say, mind, that Ariana Grande is the person onscreen that stood out most. She does an excellent job at making her character's self-centered quirks so convincing, while also producing a few amusing moments too. Jonathan Bailey and Peter Dinklage are good, while Jeff Goldblum certainly fits his role.
 
 The ending, whilst perfectly fine and pleasing, is possibly a bit rushed/abrupt, though that's to be expected given it's only part one. The same can be said for most films that are split into multiple productions, to be fair. I am intrigued to see where part two goes, bring on this time next year.
 
 The music is, as one would expect, also a positive. Granted I don't think I'll be adding any of the tracks to my playlist, but I still had a pleasant time hearing all the songs come and go - not one sticks out like a sore thumb, so that's good. Elsewhere, visually and plot-wise I have no real complaints.",8.0

 Broadway hits rely on a suspension of disbelief. With the right ingredients, even the oddest of ideas can take flight on stage… but in the delicate translation to screen, they crash-land. Take Cats: something about that core premise of humans playing felines – which theatre audiences lapped up (sorry) for decades – just didn’t work at the movies.
 
 From the outside, it’s easy to paint Wicked with the same brush. Isn’t it all a bit… silly? There’s a blonde Godiva who floats in a bubble. A green woman who was raised by a bear (and whose father may or may not be a wizard). And when they meet at a Hogwarts-style university, we find out their professor, Dr. Dillamond, is a talking goat. These aren’t exactly the trappings of a thoughtful, award-winning piece of drama. But peel back the colours of any GOOD fantasy and you’ll usually find the allegories are rich and meaningful. With its themes of parental guilt, absent fatherhood, disability, discrimination and class supremacy, Wicked is no exception.
 
 Look, we’re not saying Wicked’s perfect. At 2 hours 40 minutes, it’s knocking HARD on the “too long, wrap it up!” door. And there’s characters that either overdo it a bit (Governor Thropp) or arguably, don’t add much at all (oh Pfannee, do you even go to this school?).
 
 But that’s a bit like complaining about a scratch on a speedboat. A sleek, wondrous craft that can whiz you somewhere thrilling, and change you along the way. We didn’t have crazy high expectations – hey, the everyday moviegoer isn’t a hardcore Broadway fan – but honestly? You don’t need to be. Wicked is a movie for anyone. And maybe that’s why it feels so GOOD.",

402431,677450607d1bc87de761b911,rssp55,"I so wanted to hate it.
 
 I didn't like the decision to split the musical into two films. I didn't like the casting. I HATED the trailer, where it made the film look like it was baked with plastic, glossy CGI, or even worse Gen-AI.
 
 And I was wrong.
 
 Erivo and Grande are stellar. The co-stars aren't who I'd have picked, but they're quite excellent themselves. (Particularly the folks playing Bok and Nessa.) 
 
 It's a glorious, beautiful, and joyful film in many ways. When Elphaba finally soars, my heart soared as well and I found myself tearing up. 
 
 I also appreciated how it gives a nod to the much, much darker book, especially with the propaganda posters and effigy in the opening, and the various references to Oz's takeover. (Like when the stone edifice falls off the side of the school building revealing the animals beneath.)
 
 My only complaint is, as with any two or three-parter, lots of the filler is garbage. This is especially true  of the Dancing Through Life number, which becomes unbearably long and significantly less magical because of the added content. 
 
 Still, highly recommended. 8/10 Stars.",8.0
402431,677f1383a6778aa5b37b1b93,RalphRahal,"Wicked by Jon M. Chu is an ambitious adaptation that largely delivers on its promise to bring the magic of the beloved musical to the big screen. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vibrant set pieces and a cinematic take on Oz that feels both familiar and fresh. Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba brings an emotional depth that truly captures the character’s struggles, while Ariana Grande’s Glinda adds a balance of charm and humor. Together, their performances anchor the film and make the story’s core themes, friendship, identity, and societal perception, shine.
 
 The musical numbers are undeniably the movie’s highlight. Songs like ""Defying Gravity"" are powerful and beautifully staged, though I couldn’t help but feel the choreography, while good, could have been taken a step further to truly elevate the experience. The pacing is a mixed bag, with the first act taking its time to set the stage, which may feel slow for some. That said, once the story finds its rhythm, it balances the emotional beats with grandeur fairly well, though the shifts in tone could have been smoothed out more.
 
 Overall, Wicked succeeds as a visually impressive and emotionally resonant adaptation, even if it stumbles in a few places. It’s a solid film for fans of the musical and newcomers alike. While there’s room for improvement, particularly in pacing and choreography, it’s hard to deny that the performances and visual storytelling make it a worthwhile watch.",7.0
1195506,67d75c20b19f983ad17b9240,Brent Marchant,"It genuinely pains me when I have to say that a movie has absolutely nothing going for it, but, in the case of this celluloid trainwreck, I can come up with no other way to describe it. This overlong, frequently implausible, gratuitously violent, truly stupid offering from directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen is one of the worst excuses for a film that I have ever seen, and I’m not exaggerating when I say that. The film tells the story of Nick Caine (a.k.a. “Novocaine”) (Jack Quaid), a 30-something credit union assistant manager who suffers from a rare genetic disorder that shields him from experiencing any kind of pain or discomfort when injured, even though the physical damage to his body is real enough. He’s something of a sheltered, geeky milquetoast, having lived much of his life isolated from many of its everyday experiences as a means to protect him from potential undue harm. So it’s highly inconceivable that he somehow knows how to skillfully handle himself when caught up in a robbery of his workplace and his subsequent one-man amateur pursuit of the bad guys when they escape with a hostage, one of the facility’s tellers (Amber Midthunder), who also happens to be his new girlfriend. However, as this scenario plays out, the narrative grows progressively more preposterous with every passing frame, much of it designed to show how many times he can be shot, beat up and brutally hacked apart without ever feeling anything and yet still be able to keep going with his mission. Because of this, the sequence of events becomes increasingly repetitive, ever-more farfetched and just plain dumb, with ridiculous, over-the-top plot developments that fail to engage and frequently feature incongruous and unoriginal dialogue. But, to add real insult to injury, this release bills itself as a comedy but is virtually devoid of humor except a smattering of one-liners that mostly fall flat. This offering is so ineptly executed that it makes productions like “Joker 2” and the “John Wick” movies look like masterpieces by comparison. Indeed, if you’ve watched the trailer for this one, you’ve seen all you really need to see. “Novocaine” is a sorry excuse for contemporary filmmaking and a prime example of everything that’s wrong with the domestic motion picture industry these days, a cinematic cautionary tale for film school students on how not to make a movie. By all means, skip this one, even when it becomes available for streaming.",1.0
1195506,67ef06c4aa77e08af7991d31,r96sk,"<em>'Novocaine'</em> is fabulous entertainment! I had partially (didn't take proper notice) of one or two trailers for this and remember thinking it looked decent but a bit forced. That is not the case, especially the latter. It's terrific fun, it is very gory but in the best possible way.
 
 Jack Quaid produces as lead - a pleasingly amusing performance; his second great 2025 film after <em>'Companion'</em>, albeit with Sophie Thatcher as the star of that. Elsewhere, it's nice to see Amber Midthunder again; she is superb in 2022's <em>'Prey'</em> and is good here too.
 
 The rest of the cast are solid as well, namely Jacob Batalon and Ray Nicholson. I found the comedy to be at a sturdy level, I got the intended amusement all the way through. The plot is a bit nuts, there is a moment that isn't as surprising as intended but still worked as if it was for me.

Oh, and of course the police under the leadership of the intrepid “Mincy” (Betty Gabriel) are also on his tail and they don’t know if he’s a goodie or complicit in the crime. What we also discover along the way is that our “Nate” is a bit of a loner and it’s only his online gaming buddy “Roscoe” (Jacob Batalon) whom he can call on for assistance against this well oiled team of criminals. The joke does wear a bit thin at times, especially as not being able to feel anything appears to give him super-human powers, but that’s all part of the fun as the charismatic Quaid, ably assisted by an on-form Batalon takes us on an enjoyable series of daft adventures that bear resemblance to more than one scenario from more familiar franchises. It’s end to end stuff as geek becomes ninja, and everyone looks like they’ve had some fun making a film about a quirk with a difference. If you’re just looking for some light-entertainment to wash over you, then this will guarantee to leave your brain untaxed but you ought to get a laugh now and again.",7.0

 Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) & Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). All set off on a space mission that sees them engulfed by a mysterious storm that imbues them all with different special powers.
 
 Fantastic Four is arguably the most loved on the page of the super-group comic book creations. Certainly it's Marvel's flagship offering in that corner of the super hero market. Odd then, that when it finally makes it to the big screen they throw money at it but employ the director of ""The Firing Squad"" & ""Taxi""? The whole film reeks of nervousness, with director Tim Story either fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie, or worse still, being directed himself by studio executives fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie. While the casting of Gruffud (dull), Alba (cleavage for hire) and McMahon (out of his depth as a villain) beggars belief. Sloppy CGI fails to ignite what little action there is, while the final smack down as our intrepid 4 battle with Von Doom, is of a TV movie standard. Yet it still has a smidgen of fun about it to warrant investing a damp dark afternoon with.
 
 Chiklis and Evans are the plus points, the former injecting a bit of heart into proceedings and the latter some sexiness and some much needed humour. There's also some worth in the script's attempt at messaging about the perils and pitfalls of celebrity status. While who can deny that the first appearance of ""flame-on"" & ""clobbertime"" doesn't induce an ickle tingle down the spine of the discerning comic book fan (ok that may just be me hankering for my youth). If only the film wasn't so safe and had been in better hands. But hey! the film turned over a $230 million Worldwide profit, so what do I know eh? The sequel was inevitable, so one can only hope that with the same people involved they not only learn from their guardedness, but that they manage to stay faithful to the source and give it some much needed pizazz.

Funded by ""Victor von Doom"" (Julian McMahon) they are investigating some spacial anomaly when poor old ""Ben"" is caught unawares on an EVA and he is exposed to a hefty dose of cosmic radiation. The others thought they were safely behind an impermeable shield but upon their return to Earth they discover that they have some new quirks. ""VVD"" isn't impressed by this and soon the four must put aside their domestic grievances and unite to combat his ever increasing ambitions - and it turns out that he, being on the ship too, has powers of his own! Aside from the hunky Evans who has the most fun super-power (he can catch fire and fly like a rocket) and easily the most charisma, the rest of the casting is very much by-the-numbers, as is the dialogue and the predictable storyline. The writers have a stab at putting some humour into the film, but no amount of wit is going to help Gruffudd and his unpredictable accent (why did he even bother?) to carry this good looking but poorly delivered helping of Marvel-lite. There is also a little too much simmering romance and envy here to clutter up the main thrust of the lacklustre plot. What we end up with is actually a bit of a mess. To be fair, it does move along well enough and is only 100 minutes, or so, but really - this is an unremarkable effort from all concerned that I doubt I will ever bother watching again.",5.0

 ""Oppenheimer is a true masterclass in how to build extreme tension and suspense through fast, detailed dialogue, an insanely powerful sound production, and an equally explosive score from Ludwig Göransson. Words cannot fully describe Hoyte van Hoytema's gorgeous cinematography.
 
 It's a harrowing, disturbing, genuinely frightening story about how one man's compulsion and political power changed the world. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt shouldn't miss any awards ceremonies… they're absolutely superb, as are the rest of the exceptional actors involved in the movie.
 
 Pacing, structure, and runtime, in addition to its quasi-documentary style and its narrative complexity, make this a difficult, heavy watch that will, for sure, leave some viewers disappointed, bored, or simply tired. Ultimately, Christopher Nolan justifies the use of the expression ""not for everyone"".

The film takes the viewer into the mind of the ""Father of the atomic bomb"" how he thinks, how he feels with much accuracy. Nolan beautifully explains his life both on a private and professional front. The music, the sounds with each scene are top notch. The visuals of QUANTUM PHYSICS, FISSION, NUCLEAR EXPLOSION are mind-boggling. 
 
 If possible, watch it in IMAX. 
 
 THE MOVIE IS FULL OF DIALOGUES, CONVERSATIONS MOVING BACK AND FORTH IN TIMELINE. It's a historical biography with fantabulous acting by C.M., E.B., R.D.J. and more. The scenes with ALBERT EINSTEIN are just wow. A plethora of scientists(BOHR, FERMI, TELLER, HEISENBERG) of the age can be seen throughout.  There are no action scenes if you are in search of that.

872585,64be75ab0ed2ab00ff879c6b,Brent Marchant,"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that’s precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan’s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist’s life, chronicles his development of “the gadget” and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer’s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture’s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering’s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. “Oppenheimer” is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",9.0
872585,64c0f3411cfe3a0eb42920a4,CinemaSerf,"Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",7.0

872585,64cca2f6706e56012d655599,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it’s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.
 
 During World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.
 
 There has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that’s a far cry from what I’d call “entertaining.” It’s a great movie that’s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn’t really worth it.
 
 Nolan’s film is poignant in a way that’s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that’s plaguing society. There’s a very real moral question about humanity’s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan’s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.
 
 Nolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer’s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover’s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.
 
 “Oppenheimer” is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won’t be completely lost.
 
 In addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn’t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it’s refreshing to see a riveting movie that’s made for thinking audiences.",8.0
872585,651ade4007216600e2d6ba8d,Thulan Perera,"The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this film, delivering a poignant message about the horrors of nuclear war. The superb direction and exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and others draw you into the story, making you feel as though you are right there in the midst of it all. Even though there aren't any action scenes, the movie still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire 3-hour runtime. Oppenheimer is a biopic that everyone knows the ending to, but thanks to the expert direction and awe-inspiring performances, it is an experience that will leave a lasting impression on you.",9.0

 an incredibly well-written and extremely well-acted piece of dramatic cinema about the very eventful and complicated life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.
 
 anytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.
 
 went into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig Göransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023.
 
 the performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie.
 
 I'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. Göransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.
 
 another aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.

 I will only say that I thought it a really good movie: smartly written and nicely acted. I had some trouble following details in places — not because of the complex time structure (though I admit prefer the straight ahead story style of, say, The Godfather) but rather because I couldn’t get volume up loud enough to hear when the characters spoke softly and/or quickly, and without captions I had to wait for the context of conversations to help fill in what I was missing.

The movie was a strong testament to how much the US feared penetration by communism... and the fact that the US fear themselves losing their grip on being 'the leaders of the free world' [a title that they have never deserved or earned]... and the fact that no one has learned anything from history and being in perpetual war.

 Trust Hollywood to turn science into a bloody soap-like drama.
 
 Christopher Nolan is definitely not a person that should be tasked with making a science or history movie. His Dunkirk was underwhelming to say the least and Interstellar was both a poor movie and a joke when it came to science.

872585,658ed4069f1be76dc880cb9c,Amiiae011,"**Oppenheimer may not be for many people, but it was wonderful for me.** This movie does require some knowledge and interest in science, but it doesn't mean that you have to be an expert. I surely recommend doing some research before and after watching the film to better understand it. I also recommend researching about the simple facts of the Manhattan Project, who the people involved in the Manhattan Project are, and who Oppenheimer is before and after watching the movie.
 
 **WATCH IT ON THE BIGGEST IMAX SCREEN YOU CAN FIND, especially if you are interested in science, the true story of the Manhattan Project, and course, other Chris Nolan films. This movie was filmed specially for IMAX screening, Nolan and his crew used IMAX 70mm film and cameras, and they also invented the B&W 65mm film specially for this movie.**
 
 I have watched every single Chris Nolan’s films ever since I was a kid. His movies have been a big part of my life and his movies are the things that helped me go through tough times and give me a new dream. Oppenheimer was just staggering. It was amazing, I do not have the words to describe my feelings watching that movie, especially seeing how much improvements Cillian, Nolan and other actors have gotten through over the years, and I was so glad that Cillian is finally getting the attention he deserves too. The cinematography, the storyline, the dialogues, the characters, the music, the camera angles, position, lighting, editing, the script, and everything else were just amazing. I have read every single line of the transcript and I have already rewatched the movie 5 times to better understand it. I also am reading the American Prometheus which is amazing. After my first time watching Oppenheimer, the thoughts and questions I had after watching it stayed with me for weeks, which led me to watch it again and again. I was amazed, it was breathtaking. The cinematography was beautiful and it couldn’t have been better. The fact that Nolan didn’t use CGI for the Trinity test scene and Oppenheimer's visions of the quantum world just made me more inspired. Five stars are not enough for this movie, neither are any stars and ratings in this world. This movie is out of this world and it is a masterpiece.
 
 
 The costumes in this movie were simply amazing. The costumes were very well designed, and the colours were also amazing. It also played a huge part in the movie and helped Nolan out a lot by just contributing to making his visuals and imagination come to life. 
 
 The sound effect was unbelievable. The sound effects + Cinematography and Visual Effects made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters when all the events occurred. The Trinity test scene was also amazing, I loved how Nolan expressed the nervousness of the scientists before and after pressing the button. 
 I also absolutely loved the soundtrack of this film. Ludwig Goransson used a variety of instruments and tempos to convey the mood of the scene and the emotions of a character. The soundtrack enhances the film scenes and makes the whole film much more interesting to watch. Nothing in this world, no headphones, earphones, and speakers can be used to replicate my feelings listening to these soundtracks in an IMAX theatre.
 The casting was amazing too. The actors were excellent in portraying the difficult emotions of their characters. Cillian Murphy was amazing at representing the emotion Oppenheimer felt during his hardships over the years. The supporting actors and actresses were also amazing at playing the supporting parts in this movie and acting out how their characters had an impact on Oppenheimer's life. 
 
 If you have already watched the film and found it very fun and interesting, and if you want to learn more about how the film was made, I highly recommend you watch videos online regarding Christopher Nolan's method of making this film. I also recommend you watch interviews and the bts of this film as you may learn more amazing things about the movie and Nolan's way of filmmaking. If you want to learn more about the Manhattan Project and especially Oppenheimer's life, I highly recommend you read The American Prometheus as it is the book that Chris Nolan took the inspiration and information for this film. Although it is quite long, it is worth it. I also recommend you read the transcript of this film if you have time, as you can understand the dialogues and words better and check the parts and details you may have missed in the movie. The script is written in first person POV: Oppenheimer's viewpoint, which makes it more interesting to read, and it makes you feel like you are in the same room as the characters, even without visual effects.
 
 I was amazed at the fact that Christopher Nolan did not use CGI for this movie. Almost everything was practical and CGI was only used to enhance the look. Nolan has already amazed the cinema society with his simply staggering practical effects that were huge and well-planned. Nolan used all sorts of creative ways to recreate the iconic Trinity Test scene and the unique visions of Oppenheimer. By watching the bts of Oppenheimer, you can see how determined Nolan is to bring a masterpiece to the table.
  
 Some people may find this movie boring. If you hate movies based on history, have zero interest in science, or hate movies that require a bit of thinking and researching before and after, then probably this movie may not be for you and you might find the movie extremely _boring._ Of course, you should understand that everyone has different opinions and views about almost anything in this world so there is always a possibility that you may disagree with the things I have said here.
 **Overall, this movie is a masterpiece**. As a fan of Noaln's films and Cillian Murphy's acting ever since childhood, this film couldn't have been better. I definitely recommend you see this, as soon as possible, and on the biggest IMAX screen possible because it would be worth it. Of course, if you dislike the kinds of films I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, I don't recommend you see this film. I want to thank the crew who have worked very hard on this project, I want to thank the actors who just showed a staggering performance, I want to thank Ludwig Goransson for his amazing soundtracks in this film, and of course, I want to thank Christopher Nolan for his dedication and his amazing film, I would like to call **his masterpiece**.",10.0

 <em>'Oppenheimer'</em> lived up to the billing to me. Not that that was ever really in any doubt, with Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy in lead alongside all the acclaim that I have seen this receive since its 2023 release. The near 3hr run time is no problem whatsoever, despite more talk than anything else the film simply doesn't hold any slow/uninteresting moments - 'tis all fascinating.
 
 Ever since I found out about his casting I knew Murphy would deliver a sensational performance and that's exactly what he produces here, which is not even a tiny bit surprising - anyone who has seen television's <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">Peaky Blinders</a>'</em>, for one, would know that. Loved every single second of him onscreen.
 
 As for the rest of the cast, where do you start?! Emily Blunt is impressive, again not a shock as I'm a fan of her from other things - shoutout <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-adjustment-bureau/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Adjustment Bureau</a>'</em>. Matt Damon stars alongside Blunt in that aforementioned great flick, he himself is very good in this. Robert Downey Jr. shows quality too. All others have much less screentime but do a fair bit with it, for example Jason Clarke and Florence Pugh.

 Oppenheimer was a brilliant scientist indeed but he was also a COMMUNIST (there is a ton of evidence/articles about it and he even admitted liking communist ideas and social values, was a member of communist fronts, subscriber to communist magazines, sent them money monthly, his brother, wife, mistress and believe it or not many of his students were also known communists).
 
 He was indeed a security risk and some may go further to say that he committed an act of treason but the film presented a false image of Oppenheimer as the ""mistreated scientist"" who had to endure great injustice for the higher cause of stopping a nuclear arms race.",5.0

 Its not Hardy's fault, nor for that matter, is it the fault of the cast, in general. This thing fails because it crudely glues together, almost every tired  cop film cliche you can think of and hope's it amounts to something. 
 
 The result, as you might expect, is aimless, tedious, shallow and for me at least, unwatchable. I managed about half of this hoary affair, before calling it quits. 
 
 In short, no amount of decent acting can survive a dismal script. A truly marginal watch, at best.",4.0
668489,68114de6eb1d4b06de0ff4d6,dagtyr,"Best film I've seen in 2025. Unrelenting chaos, gore, ultra-violence. Not what I look for in a movie usually but just the right feel for our time. 
 
 Plot development: unload a magazine of rounds, and then another. The writers and director keep the finger on the trigger. If you have a sense of humour you will make it.
 
 The cgi/ai overlays which usually put me off give the scenes a fluffiness with a gamer feel. Much of the camera work is like in-game play. A raw, textured, grim cyberpunk style and low bass sounds evoke a club music video style until the action kicks off. 
 
 I could say Tom Hardy's intensity drives the story but the whole thing is intense, every action and character is caught in the raw. Jessie Mei Li's well-played character Ellie is the one who stands morally uncompromised in the mayhem, the innocent through whose unflinching eyes we observe with horror the unfolding crazy. 
 
 My favourite scene is the night club gun fight starting with the rolling train and the low beats gathering into a breaking storm of tightly choreographed fight vignettes. Lots of great fight scenes, gun sounds and action flows. 
 
 Havoc is the war of all-against-all playing out on the streets as our liberal democracies slide into a state of nature. Any attempt to make good by Hardy's character is engulfed by the force of events.

668489,6812a33b112e117481145a55,Chris Sawin,"In 2021, Gareth Evans (The Raid films, Apostle) finished filming the action thriller Havoc starring Tom Hardy for Netflix. But just like any film, Havoc needed reshoots. Due to scheduling conflicts and the SAG-AFTRA strike, Havoc sat stagnant until 2025 when it was finally released on Netflix with little to no marketing ahead of time.
 
 Patrick Walker (Hardy) is a homicide detective who has lost everything due to what he has given to his job. Set in a corrupt US city that is never named, Walker has lost everything because he has put his all into his work. It’s Christmas Eve and Walker’s ex-wife won’t let him see his six-year-old daughter because of how much of a crooked asshole he’s become.
 
 A group of thieves steal a truckload of washing machines full of cocaine to smooth things over with the local Chinese crime syndicate led by a man named Tsui. However, right when the deal seems to be going in the right direction a group of masked men burst in with assault rifles and gun everyone down including Tsui.
 
 Two surviving thieves, Charlie (Justin Cornwell) and Mia (Quelin Sepulveda) were caught on camera at the scene and are believed to be behind the assault. However, Charlie is the son of local mayoral candidate Lawrence Beaumont (Forest Whitaker). Walker has worked for Lawrence in many hush-hush jobs and now wants out. He agrees to find Charlie as his last job for Lawrence to get out for good, but Tsui’s mother (Yeo Yann Yann) has other ideas and craves revenge for her son’s death.
 
 The days of Gareth Evans nearly dying while he shoots a practical car chase like in The Raid 2 are over as Havoc is undoubtedly filled with more VFX than both of The Raid films combined. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as the VFX at least has its moments in the film. The unnamed city Havoc takes place in is gritty as hell. The colored fluorescent lighting of a city seemingly plagued by both constant rain and a slumbering city that never sees the sun adds incredible highlights to the film’s many car chases.
 
 There’s also the element of possibly noticing Tom Hardy’s face being deep faked onto someone else during the sequences involving heavy hand-to-hand combat. Considering Hardy has three stunt doubles credited in the film’s cast (one for driving and two for action), this is probably true.
 
 The story (or a lack of one) has also been a complaint of the film. Havoc plays out like a noir film with a mystery that isn’t entirely difficult to solve. The film has story beats that are similar to The Raid films and whether you can look past that or not because it’s by the same filmmaker is entirely up to you.
 
 Personally speaking, Havoc is an intense-as-hell action film that is riveting for all of its nearly two-hour duration. The VFX are bit of an adjustment especially since in some of the sequences involving cop cars they seem to float along on the nighttime concrete roads that are unnaturally fast. But this is easy to look past since it doesn’t last long.
 
 Havoc opens with a gnarly car chase between a semi-truck and several cop cars. The POV throws you directly in harm’s way with all of the crunching metal, broken headlights, and screaming sirens. The exhilarating sequence culminates with a whole ass washing machine filled to the brim with cocaine being thrown through the windshield of a cop car.
 
 Performance-wise, Patrick Walker is Eddie Brock but with uncensored vulgarity. There’s a sequence where Tom Hardy spits out “I’M A F***ING COP” and he’s just doing the Venom voice. But Hardy’s familiar performance in Havoc works as a guy who has seemingly become numb to everyone around him and is honestly only investing in one last-ditch effort to hopefully be reunited with his family.
 
 Patrick Walker is also very messy in appearance much like Eddie Brock in the two Venom sequels. Walker always has a Starbucks cup in his hand while rocking a full-blown disheveled look complete with the corners of a plaid shirt crookedly sticking out the bottom of a thrown-over black parka. Hardy looks exhausted as Walker with a harsh five o’clock shadow that is leaning on becoming a full beard.
 
 The “demons in hockey masks” sequence that ignites the film’s main storyline features a moment for Patrick Walker that is borrowed directly from Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes. As Walker arrives at the scene of the crime, he closes his eyes and begins piecing everything together in his mind. 
 
 The masked men with assault rifles point their guns over Walker’s shoulder as everyone in Tsui’s hideout is torn apart by a relentless barrage of bullets in slow motion. Walker has become accustomed to rearranging a pile of blood and corpses into something somewhat tangible.  
 
 Most of the blood in the film is CGI too, which is disappointing but it also results in some violently worthwhile visuals. Some poor man’s face is blasted all over the camera by a shotgun, which is probably much more difficult to do with practical effects.
 
 Havoc is weird because it offers a lot of what Gareth Evans is known for like messy and memorable action sequences (the entirety of the fast-paced club and cabin sequences), but it feels a bit different because of Evans's choice to lean into CGI more than he ever has. But even with that in mind, Havoc will end up being one of the best action movies of the year.",8.0

672,638132fb514c4a008789433e,Nathan,"_Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ is a worthy sequel that improves upon the first and expands the lore in a grand way.
 
 The quality in this film is vastly superior to the first in terms of CGI and acting, which is par for the course as the main trio grows into their roles and as actors. It is evident that the CGI team had adequate time before this film's release because for 2002 the effects are spectacular. From Dobby the Elf to the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, this movie nails creature models and creates very believable interactions between the models and the actors.
 
 Despite this film not having the impact in terms of discovering the magical world of Hogwarts for the first time, the story is able to improve upon its predecessor delivering an all-around stronger plot. There is a real sense of mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets and the suspense and hysteria it creates around Hogwarts is very intriguing. The stakes and the plot progression feel elevated here, creating a more seamless experience.
 
 Like previously stated, the main casts acting is improved drastically. Each actor is coming into their own and really is getting comfortable with their character. Rupert Grint steals the show with his comedic timing and cowardly presence. Emma Watson is great again but does not carry the entire trio like she had to in the previous film. There are plenty of new additions this time around and all of them were splendid. I particularly liked Dobby and Gilderoy Lockhart.
 
 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets improves upon the first in almost every aspect, and that is all you can ask for a sequel.

 Rating: A-",8.0
1100782,6712a84d1f0ea4714edc1f63,r96sk,"An improvement on the (good) original.
 
 Naomi Scott's performance is outstanding, she is so convincing and fully committed to the role all the way through - to the point that she elevates the film as a whole up a notch. The rest of the cast are good, e.g. Rosemarie DeWitt, but <em>'Smile 2'</em> is very much Scott's movie.
 
 The run time is perhaps a little longer than it needs to be, though to be honest that is only a minor criticism in the grand scheme of things. Much of what is onscreen helps nullify any potential (minor) pacing issues, the violence and gore is quite graphic but it is nicely done and is exactly what we want to see from a production of this sort, let's be real.
 
 I will say this does feature a few too many cheap jump scares, something I'm not a big fan of, but just like the above it isn't a notion that hinders the overall quality of the end result. Based on the ending, the next sequel could be a lot of fun - here's hoping!",
1100782,674251f4fb58d769bdbbb893,No,"Tween horror.  Perfect to have on in the background whilst making tiktoks or like somthing I dunno lol.
 I get the feeling the script for this was written in text speak and emojis.  I'm not sure if this is Blumhouse, I couldn't summon enough interest to bother finding out.
 
 If you've seen the first flick (not movie and certainly not film), you know what this is about, cheese ""jump scares"" that solely rely on the sound being loud and some tween-palette friendly ""gore"" - a bit of blood.  Nothing's shocking, horrifying or engaging and the ""acting"" is terrible, which is maybe the most shocking element.
 
 That guy that was in The White Lotus, I've seen be good in things other than this, he's not good in the 5 minutes or so he's in this.
 Naomi Scott waddles round like a less obese version of Florence Pugh with even less charisma.  She's pretending to be a pop star, a story misstep that leads to some AI generated music that somehow sounds a decade or so dated.
 
 Film could have been vastly improved if it was ~80 minutes of Scott being attack with a screwdriver, but that didn't happen and it's 2hours of mediocrity.  Looking at the sidebar here, it made money, so I guess we're getting Smile 3.  With some luck, that will be an entirely AI project and no actual creatives will be harmed in the creation process.",

 Director Parker Finn adopts a more mainstream approach with effective jump scares and incorporates intense gore scenes that heighten the horror experience. The narrative cleverly blurs the lines between reality and illusion, keeping viewers on edge and questioning what's real.

 Theo James is pretty good in this, for sure the most I've liked seeing him. I haven't seen him act much (five films now), my main thought of him is actually with human excrement up his nose (yep) in <em>'The Inbetweeners Movie'</em>... hopefully this performance will override that memory (it won't).
 
 The gore shown for all the titular character's escapades is very cool and rather creative to be honest, the 'freak accident' angle is a fun one to watch play out onscreen.

They wind it up and next thing, their babysitter is no more and that’s the just the start of it’s malevolence. Putting two and two together, they decide it’s best to drop the thing down a well and get on with growing up.

Equally estranged is his twin, so he’s not impressed when, out of the blue, he is called and told their aunt has died. He now has to drag the reluctant lad along to the home they grew up in and guess what is in the wardrobe? At times it’s quite funny, but I’m not sure how intentional that is as James delivers a seriously flat performance and the epitome of sibling rivalries involves a frankly risible degree of menace. It’s not that the idea is rubbish, though it is derivative, it’s that the acting and writing are poor and the scenarios - familial discord, new stepdad (Elijah Wood) etc. are all just too predictable and it provides virtually nothing new over a lacklustre one hundred minutes.

Simmons, Kiernan Shipka, Chris Evans, and Dwayne Johnson, brings a decent level of chemistry to the screen, which is one of the movie's few strengths. While the actors clearly enjoy playing off each other, the story itself is expectedly generic, relying heavily on predictable holiday tropes. The script fails to inject enough fun to offset its cliché formulas, and despite its festive intentions, the film feels stuck in cruise control, never quite capturing the magic or excitement one might hope for from a Christmas blockbuster.
 
 Technically, RED ONE falters with its visuals. Almost every scene feels confined to a studio setting, and inconsistent VFX work makes it difficult to stay immersed in the story. The action sequences, though admittedly frequent, are mostly dimly lit, which diminishes any potential impact they might have had. None of these set pieces stand out, leaving viewers with little to savor beyond the familiar faces on screen. While it's not as terrible as some have claimed, Jake Kasdan ultimately delivers just another forgettable holiday flick, weighed down by formulaic storytelling and overshadowed - quite literally - by its murky, dark aesthetic.

845781,673fd6e04dfa06b5df92deb5,r96sk,"Pretty solid festive fare, this.
 
 <em>'Red One'</em> is perhaps slightly overlong and I didn't sense much chemistry between the cast, though those onscreen still give enjoyable performances and the plot is suitably entertaining whilst giving the necessary Xmas vibes.

 Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans are fun enough in this. Johnson is a bit more serious than usual and I liked that, while Evans' character ends up being the heart of the movie. J. K. Simmons, more than Johnson, plays against type, it's actually unnerving seeing him portray a true good guy - was almost waiting for him to shout down someone's neck, as per.
 
 Kiernan Shipka is decent, as is Kristofer Hivju - I rate their characters. Lucy Liu is underused, mind. Bonnie Hunt too, I guess.

 After a key figure is kidnapped from the North Pole city of Myra, the commander of security (Dwayne Johnson) teams-up with a mercenary black-hat hacker (Chris Evans) to locate the victim (JK Simmons). They go to sunny Aruba for answers before entering the creepy lair of Krampus, Santa’s estranged adopted brother. Could the one behind the nefarious plot be the Christmas Witch, Grýla (Kiernan Shipka)?
 
 “Red One” (2024) mixes the Santa Claus mythos with Marvel’s Thor movies for a totally kick-axx Christmas flick. For verification, there’s something similar to the Bifröst Bridge in Myra; Grýla is akin to Hela; there’s the similar technologically advanced flying crafts; trolls, ogres; and so on. 
 
 The creativity scores out of the ballpark with one amusing bit after another, such as the Mythological Creatures Protection Agency (or whatever it’s called), the portals in the backs of toy stores, E.L.F., how Santa is able to make it down small chimneys, etc. Then there’s how the movie effectively appeals to both kids and adults, as well as the kids IN adults.
 
 Kiernan Shipka as the antagonist turned 23 during shooting. I knew when I saw her in “Totally Killer” that she was something special. Lucy Liu is also on hand in a fairly beefy role as the security director of Myra.

 David Fincher’s new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I’m reviewing five of Fincher’s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it’s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it’s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.
 
 Despite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can’t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I’m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.
 
 Without spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.
 
 Now, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.
 
 The second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.

It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.
 
 The second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.
 
 Don’t worry, I’m done with the negatives, and don’t forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton’s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I’ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I’d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.
 
 Fight Club approaches mental health and people’s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton’s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls’ screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.
 
 Once again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher’s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers’ score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.
 
 Last but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it’s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.
 
 In the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher’s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn’t help, but it’s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don’t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.

550,5ffe679d7d5db5003bc8340a,r96sk,"I didn't enjoy this, pretty much at all, but still kinda appreciate how it all comes together. It's a weird one for me.
 
 Overall, <em>'Fight Club'</em> underwhelmed me. I actually knew very little before viewing it, despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years; well, one 'regulatory' part of it anyway. It's much deeper than I had expected. Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.
 
 The only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.
 
 Brad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.
 
 I'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly. As noted, though, I still partially rate it weirdly. 6* feels harsh, so I give it 7*.",7.0

The ""His name was Robert Paulson"" scene specifically was where the film turned from 3 starts to 4.5 stars. Would recommend and I intend to return to this in some time as I feel it has higher rewatchability than many films of this style.",9.0

 A 30 year-old man in Los Angeles works the office drudgery, but suffers insomnia (Edward Norton). He’s finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, a devil-may-care guy who lives on the outskirts of town (Brad Pitt). They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other.
 
 ""Fight Club"" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless “revolutionaries” (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc. 
 
 That’s all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn’t compelling. I sat there bored and couldn’t wait for it to end. “Donnie Darko” (2001) had the same problem – promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it’s relatively interesting. 
 
 Moreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one’s life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn’t emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains?
 
 Cult flicks like “Pulp Fiction” (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half. But it's genius on the metaphorical level no doubt.
 
 The film is overlong at 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.

550,650b3b806c19ea00eba1f99a,chosengreatone,"This is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time, stylistically, narratively, aesthetically, and creatively.
 
 It uses very unorthodox camera angles, cute and effects to fully encapsulate this nihilistic, alternative culture that took over the late 90s and early 2000s.
 
 It has very deep views on early corporate capitalism which really arose in the 90s, and it pulls no punches to deliver its beliefs on it. It’s very persuasive in its message about corporatism as it appeals directly to men’s natural instinct and rawness. It’s a very raw movie overall.
 
 My only wish is that it could be longer. This movie SHOULD be 3 hours. But even then, it masterfully delivers an experience and segues beautifully into every scene, fulfilling every plot device and answering every question. There are no unleft answers with this movie, this movie is completely calculated and cold-hearted; much likes it main protagonist, Tyler Durden.
 
 Absolutely watch this movie!",10.0
550,65fab5eccf62cd017d55e457,CinemaSerf,"I wonder just how much of this might have been inspired by the vivid imagination of Robert Louis Stevenson? Edward Norton narrates a story that's essentially about himself. He works nine-to-five, but can't sleep. He can't explain his insomnia and after a casual aside from his doctor - who refuses to prescribe him sedatives - he starts cruising evening support groups. That's when he meets two important people. The first is ""Bob"" (Meat Loaf) who has undergone some hormone therapy that inadvertently helps him cry. Now after a bit of hugging, that skill transfers to our storyteller and the weeping seems to help with the sleeping! Success... Next, he meets ""Marla"" (Helena Bonham Carter) who also spends her evening going from group to group. Her only illness is a penchant for free doughnuts and coffee. They sort of bond - and even agree to divvy up the groups so they don't clash! It's on a flight, though, that our friend finds his life profoundly altered. He sits next to the uber-confident soap maker ""Tyler Durden"" (Brad Pitt) who offers him an whole new take on life - especially when his condo inexplicably blows up and he finds himself living with his new friend in what looks like a glorified squat. ""Punch me"" requires his pal. He gets punched back and both now seem to thrive on the ensuing and rather brutal cycle of violence. Their relationship feeds off the beatings and swiftly they are recruiting other men to their ""Fight Club"". With shades of the bare-knuckled boxing of the 19th century, they are soon atop an ever-growing group of men who almost revere their leaders. It's here that the whole story heads a little off-piste as it becomes clear that there is a much more malevolent agenda being put together by the membership. ""Durden"" starts to freeze out his friend, and now feeling more and more isolated his mental state starts to worsen. Just what's going on? Who is who? Even ""Marly"" starts to think he's lost the plot. This film is an allegorists wet dream. Just about every aspect of the characters behaviour can be used to evaluate or demonstrate  choices, freedoms, rebellion, self-awareness - even love. It's not quite so difficult to guess what the denouement will deliver, but it's a journey filled with violence (who'd be Jared Leto?), but it's increasingly used more as if it were a steam valve for something much more psychologically demanding. It's got to be Norton's best effort yet and with Pitt charismatically vacillating between the sagely and the thoroughly evil, this is thought-provoking cinema that is certainly better to watch in a cinema if you can.",7.0
14836,572922759251413060000100,talisencrw,"Neil Gaiman is so contemporarily vital, both in literature and cinema, because he more than anyone else (with the possible exception of Terry Gilliam) notes that children and adults alike are fascinated with what lies outside our observable and tangible realms of existence. He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.
 
 I definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore). Ones so well-written would truly be 'comic book movies' worth watching for me.",9.0

 I really wish more movies would follow this simple and great movie structure.  Instead of a typical 3-act structure (not that it isn't technically there), the story is much closer to that of a video game.
 
 You have a standard introductory act, but the rest of the movie is split into video game-esque ""levels"" that develop and unlock as Coraline makes new discoveries and completes different sections of the ""map"" / house.
 
 There is a lot of messaging here as well, mostly concerning relationships between children and parents and how to navigate those in regard to real life events, but everything is ""do not tell"" levels of subtle so it's not in your face at all.
 
 The Beldam itself is a magnificent creation of a ""thing that bumps in the night"" style of monster.  While there is a lot left unexplained, there is plenty that is exampled about the Beldam and her world.
 
 The movie also reminds me a lot of ""The Wizard of Oz"" in a few different ways so its good that there are family friendly movies of this quality that make vague callbacks to classic movies.",9.0
